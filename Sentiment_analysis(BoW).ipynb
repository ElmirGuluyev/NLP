It is sad how much TV comedy has deteriorated. Gone are the days of fantastic shows like Seinfeld, Cheers, Frasier, Everybody loves Raymond, Tool time etc. And they are replaces with shows like this one, with 2 dimensional stupid characters, bad acting and idiotic writing, where sleazy behavior is supposed to be funny. It is not!!!The 3 guys characters all have exactly the personality; all unlikeable, dumb, juvenile, infantile, sleazy and lack any redeeming qualities, and the girl is the same shallow personality in female version.The stories all have the same theme; juvenile pursuits of cheap thrills like one night stands (referred to as \"banging\") or getting quick cash without effort. And to get these thrills these 4 characters and even the father in season 2 are willing to do anything; \"banging\" the other guy\\'s mom, selling alcohol to minors, threatening people with Jihad terror attacks, cheating the welfare system etc.The 4 characters plus the father are supposed to be business partners and friends, but all they ever do is screw each other over. With friends like these, who need enemies?YUK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!', 'maybe i just dont get it...but crude not funny and irritating most of the time....guys that dumb shouldnt be on TV', \"It was a disappointment.

But he \\'thought\\' he was doing the right thing.  Either way, STOP RECYCLING THE EXACT SAME PLOT LINES.  And they still have everyone respond to anything with \"I understand\".  Choose a different line once in awhile !  I give this 1 star, no idea why this has an average of 4 1/2 stars.  This is by far the worst of the first 5 seasons I\\'ve watched.

Every episode, of course, is repetitive (I know it is a nursery schoolers\\' television cartoon, but there are more educational, entertaining series out there, such as \"Little Bear\" or \"Little Bill\", that can educate children without repeating themselves continuously) and predictable, even for a three-year-old child. When I was a small child, I understood that, whether you answered a fourth wall-breaking cartoon character\\'s questions or not, they were going to find out the answer on their own anyway, and it can grow tedious waiting for every little scene that you knew to expect after viewing previous episodes to be over with so the next boring, repetitive scene can appear and bring you closer to the conclusion of the episode. I know that many little children don\\'t realize that Dora will figure out the answers to her endless supply of obvious questions on her own as soon as the blue arrow clicks on a landmark along the path for her, but I did and hated to watch her.

In fact, we're gonna off the Asgard by letting them commit mass suicide and then we're going to spring a Greek tragedy on poor T'ealc. This show succeeded through its sense of humor (why else watch a show where everyone within three galaxies all speak 21st century English? Duh!).

However, in this case it proved a waste of 5 hours. The writers, directors and editors should be ashamed to put their names in the credits.

Every plot device, formula, etc., is recycled here from the other seasons, almost to the point where they feel literally cut and pasted.', 'This is a first: An unusual number of five star ratings at a rate that surpasses all of this past years Academy Award (Oscars) nominated movies put together (TOTAL). Also, interesting is that the same fanatic slasher types are hacking the heads off of any one who dares give it one star (or less). Depending on date the same reviewers gave the one star reviews a: 0 out of 25; 0 out of 14; 0 out of 13; 0 out of  12, 0 out of 11. I\\'m just happy they\\'re not all from Salem.The reason: A large number of people are making sure their Kickstarter funding for this movie proves rewarding.The movie: Simplistic dialogue that could only come from a cliche saturated Hollywood high school apprentice writer. Acting so bad the actors could manage only one short emotionless line then pause for the next actor to robotically respond in kind; back and tediously back and forth. Scenes composed of  95% dumbed down dialogue. Other 5% of scenes composed of a superficial attempt to  appear current e.g. tablets, internet video, Samsung product placement phones. Lot of formula characters e.g. dumb act cool cops; surfer dude; party people; lawyer cutouts; etc.Baddd: How bad? I was ff after 10 minutes and checking it every 10 to see if anything changed. Answer - as blandly homogenized as milk.People! For the honest reviewers not financially invested in this movie; if you want to see quality acting, storyline, sets, props and actually have to think, then watch \"The Best Offer\".

On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community. and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful.

My co-workers dropped out after only 4 episodes. I recorded the show so that I could fast forward through, hoping it would get back on track.  It never did, I kept fast forwarding through the entire season.Season 1 was great, never to be equaled by season 2.  Maybe season 3 will be better, if anyone is still watching.

This show is another one of those \"con\" jobs.  Sorry, folks, but this show is just plain lousy.  It\\'s depressing.  It goes nowhere.  The characters constantly bicker and fight.  Almost all the characters are a-holes, jerky, uninteresting, unlikable, unsympathetic.  In short, this show was torture to watch.  And still believing the hype, I tortured myself more by watching seasons 2 and 3, hoping, praying, the show would somehow get better.  It doesn\\'t.  The premise is good.  It could have been a good show.  But it is just written so poorly--unlikeable protagonists, cliched bad guys, a story that does not evolve--so the promising premise is never developed into anything good.  Even Bryan Cranston (who is a truly outstanding actor) seems bad in this.  His character has two notes, he\\'s either bitter or angry.  The people who should be bitter and angry are the people who get conned into watching this gratingly bad show.', \"Season 2 just ends in the middle of the season leaving the viewer with a HBO Soprano's ending.

They did the same thing with Pans Labrynth.It also would not have been a huge imposition on the director and producer to provide an Alternate English audio option like we do on our English speaking movies. This is the second and last time this director will ever sell any movies to me. I will never buy another of his movies even if every movie he makes from this point on is in English... because he\\'s used up any trust we may have had. So when his career goes in the dumper in the US... don\\'t blame the economy. Blame yourself for deceptive advertising and printing the DVD cover in English.

I suspect their consumers would be very angry as well.They wouldn\\'t like it anymore than the Germans would want to watch a movie in Arabic or Chinese.Amazon is also responsible for this deception by allowing it to be marketed in English. If a movie is in Spanish, then the Title should also be in Spanish. And since this is an English website... it should have a huge warning at the top of the page telling English speaking shoppers that this movie is in Spanish only!And as an added note: This director does cheesy, immature camera effects. Near the end, he just goes nuts with his 360 camera rotating around the main character... it seemed like 5 minutes of nothing but spinning.

There are other similar \"loopy and unrealistic\" TV shows, such as Ugly Betty and Scrubs, that work (I love both those shows).  But 30 Rock is just bad.  It doesn\\'t work.  It seems like in every episode they are struggling to make the show funny and the show falls flat on its face every time.

These rebels are criminal low lifes whose lives appear to be caught up in a Walter Mitty hero fantasy about being bad boy bikers.

It seems tired and worn. I enjoy the Denny Crane/Alan Shore relationship but the writing just seems to take that dynamic for granted in season 5.

So, which ever of his later characters you take, you are really just left with John Thaw. Morse is very much John and, to me, the best part of the show was the views of Oxford University. The plots are incredibly complex which does not really produce a compelling detective story; the viewer, or reader, really needs some chance of being able to solve the riddle. The character of Lewis is equally poor and boredom is never far from my mind.

I refuse to pay more than $10 - $13 with tax and shipping for a season of less than 14 episodes. The good thing is that Amazon and other sources sell not only used copies but have great sales.

But, before you press that unhelpful voting button (which, please, don\\'t do until you have read my entire review) I just want to let you know that I am not criticizing the whole series. At the beginning of its lengthy run, it was so phenomenally hysterical and witty that episodes were bound to generate at least a few chuckles from you, and the very best ones would leave you wishing that you had thought of some of the jokes featured in the episodes. Sadly, that spectacular quality has declined.In more recent years, the program has underwent a deterioration in quality (I sincerely apologize to the makers of SpongeBob SquarePants). The negative qualities of a majority of the main characters have been enhanced (stupidity, greed) as pointed out by many other people, and the episodes and specials have a \"rushed\" feel to them. They defy the boundaries and limits set by the older seasons (which, albeit they may not bother many other people, enhanced the comedy of the program and became traditional jokes for the series) and the humor has grown more grotesque and stupid. The characters are all now more annoying in an attempt to make them appear funny, and I know lots of people have noticed the same changes and also can agree that the cartoon has lost a lot of its heart.

So don\\'t watch this expecting laughs like I did, and maybe you won\\'t be disappointed.  It is extremely depressing, and if I had watched this while depressed, this movie would have made it much worse.And, by the way, to the reviewer who said not to leave negative feedback because the movie doesn\\'t live up to expectations, I say this:  It is described as a COMEDY.  Not dark humor.  Not black comedy.  Not even \"intelligent humor\" as another reviewer said.  If I had known this movie was going to be so dark and depressing, with ONLY a laugh or two, I wouldn\\'t have been expecting one of Robin Williams\\' comedies.

The suicide note he forged gets printed by the school newspaper, making his loser son, an overnight sensation. Williams is a great actor and gives credence to even a bad film like this, but even he can\\'t save this one. The story is just ridiculous, his son (Daryl Sabara) was a complete nightmare that everyone wanted dead. No one would all of a sudden care, just because he wrote a heartfelt suicide note. It\\'s also extremely unrealistic, since his son was as stupid as they come. That being said, with the exception of newcomer, Eric Martin, the rest of the supporting cast was awful, making the film that much more unrealistic. World\\'s Greatest Dad may have landed it\\'s star, but it\\'s a sloppy movie, that really doesn\\'t make a whole lot of sense.

Exaggerated maybe, but rotten kids are sometimes just a fact of reality. The actions of the father were pretty much unforgiveable so he was just as horrible in his own way.

I fondly remember seeing the original movie at the theater and was immediately impressed by its imagination. As it evolved into a weekly series I watched as my sons grew and became enthralled in the story line with me. And yes, we even liked \"Atlantis\".The Syfy channel promoted this show as an \"edgier\" Stargate. I found that this did not work for me. The very elements that made the original movie and following 15 seasons so enjoyable was now totally lost in this self-inflicted reinvention. Stories that were once fun, adventurous, full of camaraderie & humor were now jettisoned in favor of a grittier, darker, gloomier, smuttier and meandering approach.Some shows can evolve successfully. What we had here was the results of a very bad miss-calculation by MGM Television in canceling \"Atlantis\". And then upon realizing their mistake the panic-ridden response to rectify this error by delivering back unto us a forced-format that was now supposed to be better because now it was \"edgier\".\"Edgy\" can be a dangerous creative mixture with a show like Stargate. \"Edgy\" can mean daring, provocative, and/or avant-garde. But the nasty flip-side is that it can just as quickly turn into something unusual and unpleasant. And much of this \"Universe\" seemed forced and uncomfortable.Example: One early entry went something like this. \"OK, we have a room on board the Destiny that we are only now able to open and explore\"... \"Oh look, its one of those Ancient\\'s Chairs, I wonder where this will lead?\" We quickly find that it leads to an hour with an angry lesbian, a fist fight over infidelity, and \"Oh snot, my girlfriend is a stripper\".As the second-season cancellation decisively proved, this new and \"improved\" model was not the way to have gone. Yes, this was not \"your grandfather\\'s Stargate\" but as it turned out it wasn\\'t my teenage sons Stargate either. Those of us who wanted \"edgy\" adult science fiction got it from \"Battlestar Galactica\". Sometimes it is possible to \"break the mold\" and I feel this is exactly what MGM accomplished by hastily forcing this blend of science fiction together.And that\\'s a shame. First off, because the 15 seasons of Stargate SG-1/Atlantis were unique, interesting and fun. It should never have ended so suddenly. Lastly, the second season of \"Universe\" seemed to start finding itself and showed some promise. It was just unfortunate that it couldn\\'t survive the errors of the first season.I would have even accepted a couple stand-alone movies like \"Ark of the Truth\" and \"Continuum\" to have dealt with the season two cliff-hanger properly winding the show up. Though promised, I fear we will never see these. In a dorky way it would be cool to find a 10th Chevron that dialed the show back onto the airwaves.Note: You are right if you noticed that I did buy a copy of this DVD by \"Amazon\\'s Verified Purchase\" notation. I confess. I love the Stargate franchise so much, and even though these two seasons are woefully inferior, there were cameos that forever connect it and therefore makes it necessary to have in the collection. I just waited till Amazon had a crazy sale to buy them.', 'This series has none of the draw of the two previous, mostly because the characters have absolutely no depth, nor does there seem much of a chance that any will be developed.

It's like watching one of the stupid daytime soap operas that never go anywhere.\", 'Too much attention placed two male type major characters. I sick of them by the end of the season. Needed more plits', 'This outta be the typical review the lovers of this show are probably used to by now... surely enough, I love the movie, SG-1 & Atlantis... but cannot stand this one.Why? Well, I can\\'t put enough emphasis on the word BORING. It sums up most of the shows. The first episode looked promising. The SGC had discovered that dialing a 9th symbol on the Stargate could possibly take them somewhere even further than the Pegasus galaxy. There is a very large team from Earth on another planet at the far reaches of two galaxies, attempting to discover what dialing the 9th symbol leads to? Out of nowhere the planet they are on comes under attack all of a sudden by aliens, and whomever was not beamed up by Scotty had to make a run for it through the gate to the mystery of where the 9th symbol leads to.Upon escaping through the gate, they find themselves on an unmanned alien space ship that is losing power and falling apart. From then on the first couple of episodes are up and down, sometimes they have interesting things going on, but for the most part it is a lot of boring dialog between characters I, and I know many other viewers too, just could not find likable.There is a stubborn scientist, a dork who beat a computer game and was asked to join the group to lend his expertise in being attempt at a non military or scientific perspective, a young girl who is irritating, boring, not in anyway any sort of eye candy, and certainly not a strong female role model like SG1 and Atlantis provided plenty of. The only thing noteworthy of her is her father eats peaces of BLEEP for breakfast. Being that she looks 16, no normal hot blooded male over 18 is going to be watching her for other reasons than acting either... so it\\'s a losing situation either way. Not to mention, she seems to be a BLEEP (rhymes with bore) and the crush the dork has on her is more annoying than anything, because I just don\\'t care if they end up together or not when he\\'s focusing on her during every waking moment he\\'s not being told to hack into the alien ships computer and do something life saving... like unblocking the toilets.Many other characters are just as bad. In fact, no one is good at all. A blonde bimbo always doubting her medical abilities, Chun Li still trying to keep everything political by worrying about paper work rather than except the fact she is a million miles away from home and may never return, the colonel who is always being praised for how good he is supposed to be by his men, who always seem to be on the edge of insanity or blubbering like babies, which the colonel does himself when he\\'s not saying pointless dialog or switching bodies with Richie Valan\\'s and porking his missus. We had such great colonels in SG1 and Atlantis, O\\'Neil, Carter, Sheppard etc... and now we get a guy who looks as threatening as Carrot Top flicking cotton balls at you. I would even take the last two seasons of Stargate SG1\\'s team over everyone in this show!The rest of the cast pretty much mostly seem to be day players/extras and stand ins just to make it seem like there is plenty of more opportunities for more characters to come in later in the series, but i\\'m at the end of the first series now, and overall I think I have been entertained by about 15 minutes in total during the whole running of the season. So I just don\\'t care if anyone new comes in for season 2. It blew it\\'s chance by becoming a soap opera rather than everything we came to love about SG1 and Atlantis.I\\'m not sure it even comes down to bad writing, I think it\\'s the boring cast and how the whole thing is being preformed. The biggest thing that\\'s making it boring is the humor... or should I say, the lack of humor. This show has little to none at all. It\\'s mostly dark hallways and pointless dialog about their personal issues with each other or whether Eli or Rush should be the ones fiddling with alien computer programs to try and activate this and that thing to re-route power to shields, weapons or  a device that can give the annoying chick a new brain. (it happens, sigh). The rest is tedious dialogs of complaining, winging and arguments between them, taking most of the focus off of any sci-fi elements... it clearly stands out this season did not have a big enough budget to design better sets, aliens, or interesting new technologies. There was something for everyone, old and young, sci fi fan or not in SG-1 and Atlantis, this SGU version, it\\'s the worst idea for Days of Our Lives in Space that could have ever been conceived.Excitement is too far and in between. Even when guys like Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks and Amanda Tapping make guest appearances, it just does not make the show better. Everything about it is wrong. It\\'s not just the lack of humor, or adjusting to new cast members, it\\'s the entire atmosphere of the show. With SG-1 and Atlantis, you never knew what was going to happen in the next episode... but watching SG-U, you know what\\'s going to keep happening, and the new things that do happen, all I can say is zzzzzzzzzzzzzz... it was like reliving the end days of WCW Nitro. Repetitive, boring and no imagination. You know from the first few episodes it\\'s always going to be Eluid hacking this, Rush\\'s new theory on that, whats her name boring you to death with how pointless she is, moring interactions and dull emotions by the rest, and a sleazy scene thrown in now and then to try and attract 13 year olds whose mom\\'s put net nanny on their computers.I really can\\'t say it enough about how boring I found the majority of this show to be. Nothing at all worked. I still hold hopes that a Stargate finale movie or season will get financed to wrap everything in SG-1 and Atlantis up. The word about the script that was written to do so mentioned it tied together and wrapped up all 3 Stargate shows... quite frankly, if it does get made, I couldn\\'t care less if SG-U has anything to do with it, as it is the black sheep of the Stargate Universe, the actual universe, not the show with that name.And another thing... the music and soundtrack. The film, SG-1 and Atlantis had amazing scores, full orchestras that provided music that even if you didn\\'t pay much attention to it, it never interfered with the scenes, it built up intensity, set the moods for action, or made you feel emotional when it needed to be... yet this SG-U show seems to have none of that. Not even a decent title sequence theme. It copies the dumb formula from Grey\\'s Anatomy and inserts some stupid, depressing song, and plays it in it\\'s entirety... what where they thinking when they through that would be a good idea? And the so called \"creative\" and edgy soundtrack turned out to be nothing more than irritating noises. One particular episodes music was actually giving me such a headache I ejected the DVD and threw it across the room, never wanting to hear ten minutes of what sounded like a spanner being smashed into a pipe every 7 seconds with a god awful dull slow humming noise... whoever recorded that should be expelled from ever creating music for TV/Movies ever again.There is so much more I could point out on what I hated about this show, but if this information I\\'ve mentioned already doesn\\'t convince you this show sucks, or you can understand why I\\'m far from being alone on hating this show, then nothing will.', 'I should just keep my mouth shut.  But could not tolerate this show at all.  Lame.  They just recycled the Stargate saga, but out came trash.  I love the Stargate stuff, but this was just lame lame lame.', 'BOO FOR PBS. I was very disappointed that only three episodes were free for Prime Members and the remaining were for purchase. American Experience was a broadcast from Public Television which the U.S. Taxpayers support, whether they like it or not, from their taxes. To have PBS peddling this program for their monetary gain is appalling to me. This program can rot on the shelf before I would consider looking at it again.', 'As I wrote in my review of season one, season two was going to make or break Sanctuary. And it broke.Only watched the DVD set, so perhaps if I had spaced it out a bit, it might not have been so bad. Ms Tapping\\'s acting ability failed to come to work with her, effects didn\\'t improve (in some cases were worse), the werewolf guy is still a miscast (it shows more in this season). And just before I started writing this, I see there\\'s a season three!?! Poor sci-fi/fantasy fans. There\\'s so little really good stuff to watch, that some of us will take anything.No more Sanctuary for me. Ever. No surprise amazon has season two \"on sale\".', 'Tosh.0 is not for me.  I find his humor pedantic and crass.  I know many people enjoy this show.  So if you like your humor on the bawdy side maybe this one is for you.', \"This show had so much promise.  Sure some of the characters were dreadful in dialogue.  Yes, you could tell things were off to a slow start.  But when the V first hit Earth it's all very exciting.  Then the show was thrown into a pile of trash, and is generally not worth watching.  I recommend watching the series until the V introduce themselves on the giant undership screens, then hit your foot with a hammer, and save yourself the time of watching anything further.\", 'I wanted to like this show, but it was just so incredibly bad.  The story is poorly executed in the very crucial sense that there\\'s very little true drama, no intensity, no suspense, no humor, no heart, very little action.  In short, the story lacks the absolute critical elements (or ingredients) that go into good story-telling and consequently the show was not entertaining.  The only real story seemed to be the supposedly-friendly-acting-but-really-sinister aliens (aka the Visitors or the Vees) have some super secret evil plan that a handful of humans and \"truly friendly\" aliens are trying to reveal and stop.  That single lone storyline takes up the entire season and it flimsily and boringly drags on and on and on for the entire first season with a few vapid sub-stories thrown in.  So the season was really boring since the story never seemed to progress, mature or truly go anywhere.  Watching it was frustrating.  And making matters worse is the fact that all the characters are boring and uninteresting--the FBI agent, the Priest, the hammy over-the-top Mercenary-type, the friendly \"black guy\" alien--are all boring.  The writing is so weak on this show.  The acting is bad.  The SFX are bad--I\\'ve never seen worse green screen SFX shots on any TV show.  For a truly good SCI-FI TV re-make, check out the re-do/re-make of \"Battlestar Galactica\" (Seasons 1-3).  That was an excellent re-make of an older SCI-FI TV show.  This remake of V is a colossal disappointment.', \"Don't like subtitles in my movies.  Most Asian movies turn me off completely..

On a personal comedy-club level, this is acceptable. Once commercialized with music and fake laugh tracks, this show went to hell. In Dunham's case, since his entire show is based upon puppets, to come up with new material, you have to come up with new puppets. The scenarios that he has come up with...visiting real people and businesses and warping out obnoxiousness for humor's sake...is NOT funny. Let's not forget Dunham is JNew W*rld Ord*r and his denigration of and overt racism for the White Christian and Muslim races is nothing short of criminal! You see what his race of people REALLY thinks about other races on the planet! His stuff is NOT funny and he's reached the end of his rope...perhaps he'll hang himself with it!\", '\"The Jeff Dunham Show\" is a Comedy Central offshoot of Jeff Dunham\\'s live shows using the familiar characters Walter, Achmed, Bubba J, Sweet Daddy Dee, Peanut, and Jose Jalapeno. In this seven episode season, Dunham introduces his characters onstage in front of an audience and then goes to a clip of them out in the real world trying to interact with other people.Watching the show, the format is VERY similar to the Dave Chappelle Show where he would interact with the audience and introduce segments and then go to the clip in a sketch comedy sort of way. However, the difference between Dave Chappelle and Jeff Dunham was that Chappelle was really good at this. When Dunham takes his characters out in public, the audience is supposed to believe they are real people and other actors and celebrities talk to the puppets. For example, Brooke Hogan is set up with Peanut on a date until Peanut \"eats\" some guacamole laced with nuts that he is allergic to and Achmed intercepts the date to put the moves on her. We see the characters\\' feet, dancing with other people, shooting guns, all sorts of things.If you like these characters and think they are funny on their own, than this show will probably work for you and you\\'ll enjoy it. The magic of the previous live show format was that everyone marveled at Dunham\\'s ability to DO these characters since ventriloquism isn\\'t easy and there was always potential for him to start cracking up too much or making a mistake or Achmed\\'s arm falling off which would increase the hilarity of any given bit. Taking the \"live\" quality out of the format with everything being pre-taped in these segments means they could have used as many takes as they wanted to finish a scene, so it just isn\\'t as impressive as when it is done on the spot. Also the scenes themselves just aren\\'t written that funny anyway.The concept of Jeff Dunham having his own show sounds great, but this format does not work for his brand of comedy and talents effectively.Bonus Features:Behind the Scenes shows the making of sketches of Achmed joining the Marines and also Achmed\\'s funeral. Jeff Dunham is smart enough to know that Achmed is one of his most universally liked characters due to his talking in a wittle cute voice and varying inbetween that and temper rages. These segments aren\\'t more than a few minutes and include some Comedy Central Promos.The unaired sketch is with Sweet Daddy Dee, a character I don\\'t even remember from other specials I\\'ve seen from Jeff Dunham. He apparently gets to wear lots of chain bling and slang. His cut scene is Sweet Daddy Dee helping Germans get rid of an acapella group singing in the attic. Yes, the attic. He turns them into a Bavarian singing group to save them and when the Germans still don\\'t like them, Nazi and \"The Sound of Music\" jokes abound. A good choice to cut.The bloopers show that his live bits introducing scenes often had to be retaped, especially when he starts coughing. He often forgets his lines and starts laughing and stuff goes wrong with the puppets getting their hands stuck on walls.', 'I guess I\\'m the odd one because I found it to be rather stupid - sorry, couldn\\'t think of another word to describe my feelings about it. I decided to fast forward through, hoping to come to something that would be interesting, funny, good.... Just when I thought it couldn\\'t get any stupider, the girlfriend shows up and voila, it got stupider. Even the ending, which was supposed to be a \"gotcha\" I guess, just didn\\'t have any juice. Was also difficult to see Meg Ryan, whom I\\'d always enjoyed, with the beginnings of messing up her face. A pathetic and somewhat creepy story.', 'When she is informed by her husband of thirteen years that he is leaving her for another woman, Louise does what every self-respecting woman in her position would do: she conks him over the head, duct-tapes him to a chair, and threatens to hold him prisoner till he comes to his senses. Thus, for an hour-and-a-half, we\\'re forced to watch as two self-indulgent crybabies - one a cheat, the other a raving psychotic - thrash out the details of their relationship in a tone so grating and mean-spirited that before long we\\'re ready to send in our own hostage-negotiating team just to bring an end to all of our suffering.Despite the presence of Meg Ryan, Tim Hutton, Kristen Bell and Justin Long in key roles, \"Serious Moonlight,\" directed by Cheryl Hines and written by the late Adrienne Shelly (both of \"Waitress\" fame), is a hopelessly contrived, endlessly off-putting dark romantic comedy (a la \"The War of the Roses,\" albeit without the courage of that film\\'s ending) that, I guess, is supposed to be every cheated-on spouse\\'s idea of the perfect wish-fulfillment revenge fantasy (even if the fantasy winds up going awry in the end). But the claustrophobic setting, the sadistic tone, and the sheer unpleasantness of it all make it an excruciating experience to sit through. At one point, Hutton seems to be speaking for the audience when he states, \"It\\'s like torture.\" That\\'s about as astute an example of built-in self-criticism as I\\'ve ever come across in a movie.', \"Mind you, this review is coming from someone who could care less about the STAR TREK series and films. I went along with a few friends to see this, and while I really enjoyed the first forty minutes, the rest of the film was rather weak. I didn't care for any of the characters. Maybe it's just me. Science fiction is my least favorite genre. I can say this: the acting was well done. I was surprised by how good they were. Bravo to the actors. As for the rest of the film, well, lets just say I won't be seeing it again.See it if you must. Trekkies will get a lot more out of the film than I did.

I was disappointed.Why is there a minimum word usage', \"The description for the Eclipse is 100% completely *wrong*.  This is NOT a suspense- it's a romance with subtle elements of drama.  We were all fooled into thinking this was some kind of horror story involving a ghost writer being tormented but it's anything but.  We were also fooled into believing there would be serious discussions involving what it feels like to actually witness a ghost for real and how the human mind feels after witnessing such a traumatic event.Instead it's about a ghost writer who meets a woman who shares similar interests in ghostly activity and they gradually fall in love.  Of course there's another guy in the picture, who's apparently a boxer.  Well the two guys hate each other and are secretly jealous over the woman without actually coming out and admitting it.  Instead we discover that the boxer basically believes the ghost writer is a stalker, while the ghost writer believes the boxer is a drunk.There's only two segments that are worth your time.  One takes place about an hour in when the ghost writer opens his bedroom closet and a scary event takes place in the floorboards, and the other is the fist fight between the two men above.  That's it.  The rest of the storytelling is meaningless and painful to watch.It's a shame too- this movie looks like it takes place in either Ireland or the gorgeous countrysides of England which are *perfect* locations for a horror setting.  Instead it doesn't even try for a supernatural setting.  I recommend skipping it completely.\", 'There is no mystery in this movie what so ever; there are no ghosts; there is nothing supernatural. Just ignorance. Everyone has lost someone that they love but to randomly toss in a couple of fakey slightly scarred head shots in spots that make no sense (e.g. in the car seat next to you; under some stuff in a room) or a couple of brief ghostly apparition scenes lasting a few seconds that do nothing - please! That any of these mysteries are part of illusionary compensation for losing someone is beyond belief. Also, to intermingle and confuse the one story line with another with an artificial good guy - bad guy - cute girl love triangle seems to be added to appease a certain viewing demographic but has no other function in this supposedly \"spine-tinglingly\" supernatural thriller.Finally, what does an eclipse have to do with the fundamental plot/story of the movie?', 'What a horrible bunch of garbage.

Romantic relationships appear \"out of the blue.\" Some characters disappear into thin air and the plot is so disjointed that I felt the whole thing was a waste of time. It\\'s a pity because the trailer looked good and Lenora Watling is certainly easy to look at, but Elijah Wood is just plain HORRIBLE and quite frankly, other than her looks, Ms. Watling doesn\\'t impress much either.

I'd seen a clip of the show on the internet and thought it was interesting, but the lead just gave me bad vibes. Watching the first three episodes last night, I just couldn't take it anymore! Callie, his love interest, is totally annoying. She is a nurse who also goes to medical school and has a son. Jim is a know-it-all punk who always magically has the upper hand. There is no explanation at all for why or how he outsmarts everyone, he just does. The characters is very smug and unlikeable. Maybe he appeals to narcissistic Generation X and Y types, but not me. Furthermore, Jim doesn't have any depth. He is in jerk mode all of the time. He's not even vulnerable. This is the worst written show on TV!The character is just not believable as a cop. He acts like a rich prep schooler. I believe that he is supposed to be middle-class, but the writers probably can't even comprehend how to create a middle-class character, so they based one off of their own privileged lives. It's almost like they couldn't stand writing Callie as just a nurse, so they made her a nurse who is trying to be a doctor! Now she's classy enough for the show!I got bored during episodes. The shows I watched began with a murder, then just became disjointed as time went on. Jim would investigate, meet up with Callie, make sarcastic comments, then there would be a final magical scene that resolves everything perfectly. The Carlos Gomez character is the only interesting one that comes across as human, but even he has no chemistry with the lead.I just couldn't stand the show anymore and I put it up for sale. I really don't recommend it.\", \"I didn't like this program, it is inane and a pilot that must be trying to boost the actor's career, and he overacts his part in comparison to the rest of the show.

This show, however, is not at all five star worthy by any honest stretch of the imagination. The show has low production values, low budget actors, and consequently poor acting. And for a crime show it makes leaps and jumps that make it impossible to follow, which means there is no chance that the viewer will ever figure out who the killer is. As well, there is a lot of product placement -- even more so then usual nowadays. The show also is something of a surreptitious pro-smoking cigarette commercial, with all the young hip, cool people conspicuously enjoying - really enjoying -- their cigarettes. That this show lasted four years is more of an indictment on our society and our exceedingly low expectations than any evidence that it was a \"successful\" program.

The humor is composed of bad word-play that can barely inspire chuckles in anybody, along with funny words and speech. It just comes off as cheesy, and albeit a bit of the humor in this situation comedy is usually the sort of comedy that I would find humorous, for some reason it just cannot make me laugh. True, a few times there have been a couple of gags that have left me rolling on the floor laughing, but for the most part this series just does not amuse me. There are a few episodes that I like to watch, but I really do not like \"iCarly\" very much.

It adds blood arcing for some distance into the sky when a lance meets an eyeball. And there are two feral lady barbarians, one blond with what looks like bad teeth (Aeron, played by Axelle Carolyn) and one brunette, whose teeth look just fine, as do her breasts (Etain, played silently by Olga Kurylenko). The brunette fancies skins when she goes out hunting Romans in the deep winter forest and scanty skins when in a hut.Centurion, in other words, is as silly as they come. Briefly, it's about an attempt by the Ninth Legion, led by General Titus Flavius Virilus (Dominic West), to march north into what is now Scotland and eliminate the Pict threat. Evidently Virilus never read up on the fate of Publius Quinctilius Varus, no general but a good administrator. Marching deep into the Teutoburg Forest in what is now Germany, he and his three legions were attacked by combined Germanic tribes. Varus committed suicide in the middle of the battle. His three legions disintegrated. Probably 20,000 or more Roman soldiers died compared to a handful of barbarians.General Virilus, virile and confidant, who didn't read his history, marches his men into the thick forests of Pictland.  Flash forward to the next day. Virilus is in chains in the squalid camp of the Pict king. Most of his men have been slaughtered. Later, a handful of survivors led by Centurion Quintus Dias (Michael Fassbender) try to rescue him. No luck. The Pict king's young son is killed and the general dies in a forced fight with Etain. The seven Romans escape and head south with a handful of Pict hunters (led by Etain and Aeron) hot on their trail. Pict hunters die one by one; the Roman seven almost die one by one.What's good about Centurion? The make-up and the set-designer. Picts look as dirty and flea-bitten as their filthy encampments. Most of the Romans look as filthy as the Picts. There are stunning, craggy, shivering cold scenes of the Highlands.What lacks in Centurion? Characters we can give even a small hoot for. Most of the time we can't remember one from another. Fassbender seems to be a rising star, but all he's called upon to do in this movie is fight, run monotonously and look tired. Only one actor in the cast stands out as tough and smart, and that is that fine actor Liam Cunningham. He's made a lot of drek, but look for him inShooting the Past,Dog SoldiersandThe Wind That Shakes the Barley. The movie's battle scenes, particularly Virilus' march north, is shot only to show slashing swords and more spurts of blood. There's no way to follow the battles. A plot also is lacking. The first third is an excuse for gore. The last two-thirds is an excuse for gore and long-distance running. The roles of Etain and Aeron are a sop to the 18-29-year-old audience the director seems to care most for.Centurion is not a movie. It's a mediocre comic book for all those who love abs-enhancing armor, horsehair helmet crests and the inspiring National Geographic maps showing the Roman Empire at its greatest extent.\", 'This movie has gushing blood and lots of use of the &#34;f&#34; word and not much else.  Not even the women were spared from punched out eyeballs and blood oozing everywhere.  They had their lipstick on though.

Then we cut to their first day on the job where they spend 90% of their time with their guns drawn saying \"don\\'t make me shoot you\". AWFUL, STUPID, HORRIBLE! This show is an insult to anyone in law enforcement and to the public they serve. Mind you I have no problem with \\'pretty actors\\' doing soap opera/drama.

The Event, along with The 4400 to mention another great show that was canceled without any closure, had a lot of different story lines which had the potential for some great stuff.  That is the reason for the hate it rating, producers and executives don't deserve positive credit for shows with great writing and acting that they themselves cancel.

However, this was his last episode on the show and with that, I had completely had it with this reincarnation of one of my favorite shows, the original LAW AND ORDER set in NYC.  The problems with this show are manifold.  The worst is that it is trying to be a hybrid of the original show with a CSI show.  So instead of the excellence of a team which had Jerry Orbach and Sam Waterston in the gritty New York scene, there is this technicolor mess of a show trying to infuse us with the coolness of the hopped up LA scene.  All this is missing is the Horatio from CSI Miami with his sunglasses to cement it as a truly unbelievable show.  The CRIMINAL INTENT version of this show was also ruined by constantly reinventing a concept which worked.  It too became unwatchable with Jeff Goldblum at the helm.  My recommendation is to skip this show and stick to the reruns of the original, especially the ones with Waterston and Orbach in their primes.', 'There are no surprises in this Law and Order series with predictable plots and characters except for a little more sunshine, LA location wise.

While I had a long-standing desire to read the book, I hadn\\'t heard of the concordant documentary and was anxious to see it when I did hear about it.Before I go on, let me regale you with the latest shill\\'s message to me regarding this film: \"It is your assertions of racism, etc. that are anti-intellectual. I could, in fact argue that YOUR discussion of \"Black names\" reflects a rather insidious degree of bigotry. In addition, your criticisms of the quality of the data are amazingly uninformed.\"WOW. Sell a lot of books this way, do you? By insulting an honest reviewer, then demanding back-up evidence? This is a REVIEW, not a doctoral thesis. The idiots who made this film have the burden - not I. Mine is onerous enough writing to audiences filled with readers like YOU. And the filmmakers are the ones who raise the whole issue of \"black\" names, not I. And that is what you can expect from a film like this.The film is a huge let-down; it certainly steered me away from the desire to read the book. I\\'ve come to the conclusion that the appellation \"rogue economist\" (as Levitt calls himself) is a big red flag with Sarah Palin\\'s silhouette on it.Full of somewhat interesting but ultimately useless and mildly offensive trivia, the documentary\\'s biggest mystery is why several directors were hired to film the various segments. Some of the segments are downright insulting to the intelligence.In a word, stupid. Or, in another word, Wallywood. So here are the basic parts of this broken machine:REALTORS ROBBING CLIENTS: Levitt and Dubner yammer about the way realtors rip off their clients in the good old American home-selling scheme. While I found it informative, it could have been done more briefly and a lot more deeply.CHILDREN\\'S NAMES: This is about whether a child\\'s name will affect that child\\'s success later in life. It seems Levitt\\'s whole point is to show how certain names could lead white girls to a stripper\\'s life. I found this segment racist, aside from being offensive and frankly stupid.We all know the black community prefers specific names, and the documentary explains the well known phenomenon of black people getting the shaft when it comes to jobs. I doubt that is only because of the names the black community chooses but this film insists it is. In any case, I do not need statistics to explain that to me: I am half black.However, Levitt (the apparent heavy-lifter in all the fact-finding) tells us more: did you know that among rich white folk, the most popular names for girls used to be Jessica, Lauren, Ashley, Sarah and Emily? Among \"the Wal~Mart crowd\" (their term, not mine), the most popular names were Ashley (\"Trashley\"), Jessica, Amanda, Samantha and Brittney.I was having a hard time understanding how the white strippers relate to the problems of the black community and vice-versa, but there you are. Apparently, these two stalwart researchers also claim that the name Tyrone \"is a black name.\" I have news for you: it is not a \"black\" name. The only thing in the world that is \"black\" in this context is the skin of some people. And that\\'s not \"black\", it\\'s \"brown\".Gee, I guess pointing that out makes me the racist here.SUMO MATCHES ARE FIXED: Next we have a segment about Sumo wrestling corruption in Japan. Plus the exciting topic about Japanese police and their general incompetence. It\\'s really a segment about religious corruption because Sumo is a sort of extension under the Shinto religion. This was a good segment, but a totally confusing mish-mash if you are not already familiar with Japanese culture - which this documentary assumes you are.ROE V. WADE DROPPED OUR CRIME RATES: These dummies claim Roe v. Wade and the whole abortion issue might just be the answer to lower crime rates. How\\'s that? - you may well ask. Levitt did a study of the evil Romanian dictator Ceaucescu and his draconian you-have-to-have-a-baby-NOW laws from circa 1989. Levitt found that about 20 years later, Romanian crime had skyrocketed. Coincidence?Based on this interestingly weak observation, Levitt decided to study U.S. crime rates dating 20 years after the Roe v. Wade decision. He claims he found crime had plummeted. Levitt asserts 50% of that total drop was thanks to Roe v. Wade and all the criminals-to-be that were never born. Allow me to explain why this is bad statistical use: Levitt freely asserts 50% of the drop in crime to be thanks to Roe v. Wade. He presents no evidence that he delved into ALL the necessary statistics to make that assertion.What is freely asserted is freely negated - any critics of my review familiar with THAT? If anyone expects me to quote statistical analysis here for the purpose of refuting these clowns, well, I don\\'t have to do so. The burden is Levitt\\'s. And he fails.BRIBE THE KIDS TO GET GOOD GRADES: For me this was the most stupid segment: an experiment in Chicago to bribe 9th graders to get good grades. The authors of the experiment believed bribes can and should be used to get these kids to do their schoolwork. As opposed to getting out on the street, joining a gang and possibly making several thousands of dollars a day doing whatever it is the gangs do.This type of film pains me. It is the usual pseudo-intellectualism camouflaged as something I can only label as \\'significant trivia\\', and it has more to do with arrogant researchers who are full of themselves than it has to do with facts. Naturally, it deeply moves pseudo-intellectuals. This film tries to be light-hearted and humorous, but it falls flat.These \"experts\" are offensive idiots: they manage to insult the poor of all colors (is that funny?), the black community (oh, that MUST be funny), struggling parents (definitely not funny and most unwise) AND kids in dire need (just plain horrible and psycho). We can safely add that the authors/film narrators in some odd way have made pro-abortion people feel weird also.Imagine how they have offended cinema and the art of documentation.This certainly put me off reading the authors\\' book. Since I have a little bird who tells me things, I have had it brought to my attention that Levitt and Dubner \"read reviews\". Well, gentlemen, I hope you learned something from my review. The public has a right to know all balanced criticisms. Apparently, some strange enemy has read my review already anyway.Please know: my review is a great deal more fair than the documentary.', 'this  is just democrat smoke cloud spewingmarkets always workbecause they just let people produce, own what they produce, and trade freelyall government does is steal from thatand the make all poorerwhen price fall everyone richer, and they do natuallygovernment printing moeny and deficit spending should be bannedalso ban welfareincluding governemtn money to schools and universitiesend warsand economy take off liek rocket with insane amounts of private trains, atomci powerplants, and union free business of all sorts with nonstop innovation', \"While I found a lot of the subjects interesting, I thought the film was seriously slow and boring. I like documentaries and even though this one starts out promising, it quickly gets old and really doesn't give us much insight on the subjects at hand.

Read the book, you'll be much better off.\", \"I have no opinion of the video, since I couldn't get it to play on my pc.  sorry!

The final seen of the monsters is some kind of land walking Octopus types with a lot of extra arms, which could not exist on land.  The Octopus type body is made only for a water environment and could not move on land.  And these monsters were not all that distinct.  The monsters do a lot of guttural and screeching sounds.

I am not sure this series is still on the air but if its not I can see why.Id pass on this.', 'This is a really terrible movie.  Let me describe it by splitting the film into two sections.  Let me explain the first half first.The first half of the movie is totally fitting for the Lifetime Movie Network.  It\\'s about a woman who lives in an apartment building and, while a man is fixing a plumbing problem under her kitchen sink,  they fall in love.  Little does she know the man who has a history of mental illness.  Well she DOES eventually realize this but not until she\\'s already committed to the guy.Let me state that what the guy does for a living is completely meaningless.  He works in real estate and it\\'s a family business, hence the constant sarcastic bickering between him and his father about \"making the right choices for the sake of the family\".  None of this matters though.  The focus here is on the man and woman attempting to hit off a relationship.Well for the entire first half of the movie, the man and woman go through the routine ups and downs of being in a relationship, however since the man has a mental condition due to him having to tragically witness his mother jumping and killing herself when he was a child, this problem interferes with his ability to want to have kids with the woman and... now things get worse- MUCH worse.  Apparently the woman brought back personal feelings that weren\\'t meant to see the light of day.  Now these mental problems have been unleashed.  Sounds fun so far, right?  Read on.Let me mention that everything about the man and woman falling in love is flat out *boring* because I\\'ve seen an identical build-up of typical relationship highs and lows in several other films, so nothing different was done here at all.  I mean it was written in such a predictable way here that it\\'s totally pointless to watch.  In fact the one and only scene that made an effort to stand out and be different is when the man gets furious at his wife who\\'s simply minding her own business at a dinner party and he comes storming in the room, grabs her by the hair and pulls her out of the house.  Nobody at the party seemed to think this was unordinary behavior or stood up for the woman.  What?Even worse is that whenever something good happens such as this, the writing completely falls apart so the very next scene shifts in another direction, thereby destroying all suspense that could have occurred.  Terrible.  It\\'s obvious the man is crazy but nothing really suspenseful other than the guy destroying a book shelf and making a few threats ever seem to come out of it.Now the second part of the film.  This is when the storyline completely falls flat.  This is when the amount of confusion will probably leave you speechless.  Well apparently the wife disappears, so we flash several years into the future with the husband as an old man, in a courtroom, and attempting to explain his innocence but... now the storyline is completely focused around the characters as OLDER people so suddenly it\\'s like watching a completely different movie, and... get THIS- now we\\'re seeing the man accused of murdering his wife dressed up as a woman *himself* and involved in conflicts with other older people that do absolutely nothing but confuse the living heck out of me.Suddenly MURDERS are now occurring, which is odd because you\\'d think growing older would mean becoming wiser and less violent.  Suddenly as an old man, he\\'s doing drugs with a friend in a car and wearing make-up like a woman.  Whatever (or whoever) is responsible for these murders being committed when it would seem these characters don\\'t have much time on the planet anyway since old age has creeped in is beyond my understanding- WAY beyond it.Bored by the generic writing of the first half and confused by the second half makes this movie an absolute failure.  A double dose of failure in fact because \"bored and confused\" is the worst of BOTH worlds when it comes to movie storytelling.  Ugh!  I strongly recommend avoiding this hogwash!', 'I should have rented this confused, disjointed hodge-podge from Netflix, rather than having wasted the miniscule amount it cost me to purchase from Costco.Utter junk!

Why does he need to stand in front of a field of mathematical formulas as if to suggest he is a higher order of intelligence when nothing anyone does has to do with math? The onset of the stories sounds interesting that Brad gives in the set up. The problem is that Brad does nothing!! He sits in front of a green screen and does no investigation himself. He has this team of \"experts\" who are totally laughable go out and \"discover\" the truth. One guy is writing notes the whole time (scribble scribble). The chick usually has nothing to do. The other guy is the driver who seems like he is still learning his job.Most of the time in their investigation, they take some red herring and find themselves out in left field from where they began. So what they find ends up being irrelevant and has no solid relationship to the initial conspiracy. I am watching the Lewis and Clark episode and whether or not Lewis committed suicide or not. In the end, there was no real information brought to the table that was not already said in the beginning.Much of the show is already set up, even before the so called investigations occur. There is no real inquiry, its just published information. As the case with Lewis, clearly the idea of whether he killed himself or not is not a new one as there are a bunch of books already published. In fact, they go and talk to an author and gets lots of \"yes\\'s\".The show in general comes off as series of smoke and mirrors. Lots of flashy editing, zoom cuts, sound effects, and incidental music to create the effect. Brad chimes in saying nothing important, but usually either retelling what has happened, or foretelling what his \"experts\" will find out. So everything is already figured out.I watch the show out of curiosity and to see how many holes are in the episode. I really dont find him convincing or that the show brings out any secret history that might already be written elsewhere. I have never read his books and can see he has some reputation in the field.

I watched it. I\\'ll try almost anything once.Once is too much.The story is about a good cop who gets framed by the evil owner of a gigantic corporation/crime syndicate. Since he is assumed to be dead, he cannot go back to his wife or son - though, in a maudlin moment, he visits the boy while the boy is sleeping. There should have been a puppy and some kittens.At the burial service for him, the cop watches from behind a tree, about as difficult to spot as the Washington Monument in DC. Somehow, though, all the police, whom one assumes to be alert and vigilant, miss his presence.Anyway, somehow, and I really do not understand how or why, he gets involved with a circus that seems to have about six members. They seem to perform before a similar number of people. Sets are not a strong point. He performs by battling a small person (ok - dwarf) of extraordinary fighting ability and numerous tattoos.The circus is run by a large black guy whose overacting is great enough to be the converse of Keanu Reeves, if Reeves were actually trying to act. The black guy is a master magician, and he trains the ex-cop to use a cape formerly used by a now departed magician - the magic is fake, but it is allowed to seem almost real to the audience in the course of the episode. Since he used to read a comic called \"The Cape\" to his son to put him to sleep, the ex-cop assumes the identity of \"The Cape.\" This might put you to sleep.The bad guy has a British accent and occasional not human eyes, and he has been committing crimes in costume, even though he is the head of a huge conglomerate. For sheer fun, one presumes. These are the crimes pinned on the ex-cop. They are designed to force \"the city\" to privatize its police force by turning it over to his corporation, which the city promptly does. Global domination to follow.The circus members are either committed to destroying the bad guy or become immediately so dedicated, and the Cape and they rob banks belonging to the corporation.The evil overlord\\'s head henchman turns out to be the Cape\\'s former best friend and police partner, who framed him because Mr. Evil threatened to harm his family. He is, however, not a happy henchman. In these sorts of bad movies/shows, having a family is a definite no-no.I don\\'t know who any of the actors were, but none of them were very good, except for the little person who has some comic flair.The show is half serious and half camp/cartoon and occasionally funny.

I have stated many times before that the audience in ANY horror/thriller movie sometimes is asked to suspend logic, but I think ANY audience deserves a few answers--even fleeting ones.  None exist in this movie.It begins with four different main characters coming to the realization that they may be the only people left in this City because everyone else has vanished.  All that is left behind are piles of clothing.  That brought me to question one:  why did they survive?  They then spend a good amount of time stumbling and mumbling through various and sundry situations, which brings me to question 2:  was this the ONLY city that had experienced a \"vanishing\"?  You are then treated to more and more scenes of utter stupidity and the constant chanting of \"I exist; I exist\" until they all start to be picked off by the \"shadow people.\"  This led me to my next set of questions:  why couldn\\'t they find some generators at a local store and have all the lights they wanted?  Why couldn\\'t they light (and keep lit) a fire?  Why did they STAY in that City?  And last (but certainly not least) WHY DID I WASTE MY TIME?Other reviewers have hinted at this movie\\'s potential.  I\\'m just not sure that it ever HAD any potential.  I didn\\'t really care for the majority of the survivors and they all continued to make such stupid, moronic choices I was actually rooting for the shadows!Rated R for, hmmmmm, I don\\'t know what for.', 'The time I spent watching this movie that I could have spent doing something else. It actually takes real effort to make a movie this bad. First and foremost this movie is mainly about a backup generator and how long it can stay running. Apparently that\\'s the best plot this movie has to offer. There\\'s also a locked room (that\\'s the sub plot) but maybe they are saving that for the next movie because no one ever bothers to find out what\\'s behind the door.Other than than you have a bunch of people running away from shadows and looking for flashlights that work. You think that with an entire city gone they could have stopped by Radio shack and got a cart full of flashlights and batteries to haul around. Maybe even stopped by Sears and got a new generator? If all else failed the least they could do is stop at the supermarket and get some matches and lawn torches. Sadly hour main characters aren\\'t that bright. Probably the worse survival group in this history of survival horror (I think that\\'s what this was trying to be) *spoiler here* no wonder none of them survive.The monsters in this movie are shadows. They were creepy for about the first 5 minutes than after that just plain boring. No scares, or real sense of danger to be found in this movie. Only if your afraid of your own shadow than maybe just maybe. For some reason I remember another movie about people running around trying to find lights to keep on so they didn\\'t vanish in the dark. I forget what it was called but it wasn\\'t that old. That movie was a yawner as well (probably why I forgot it). I know this movie will soon \"vanish\" from my mind because there isn\\'t anything worth remembering from it other than I need to pick up some batteries just in case the power goes out. Last time the power went out I had to bump around in the dark looking for matches and luckily I found some old birthday candles.This movie was such a waste of time it should have never been made. The characters are pointless, the movie has no plot, it never goes anywhere, it carries on to long, and nothing about what\\'s taking place is explained. I\\'m all for these weird sci-fi no explanation movies but if you\\'re going to do them at least do it right like War of the Worlds.

In short, they\\'re real people and I love that since it gives the show an added depth of reality that keeps one believing in the plot no matter how outlandish it gets.

I own this movie, it was fun in a shallow, forget-it-ten-seconds-after-it's-over kind of a way, but I really can't recommend it as good cinema.\", \"during the reformation, the great schism ignited by martin luther between roman catholicism and the new protestantism of the north, luther compared rome to sodom, and scaled sodom as the runner up...the war that ensued included every atrocity that could be imagined, such as the impaling of individuals on sharpened tree limbs, roasting them over a slow fire, and slashing open the bellies of pregnant women and flinging their unborn children to ravenous dogs...in other words, it was a fairly ordinary war...but i have little taste for such spectacles, and i find it difficult to believe that an actor of rutger's stature would immerse himself to the ears in a slasher movie that attempts, however futilely, to outrevulse all contenders...at least the trailer gives fair warning, but the high rating it is accorded by critics who have damned to near death films of real quality, with tedious cavils and faint praises, is entirely outrageous.\", \"I understand what they were going for, and I enjoy 70's/80's grindhouse stuff, but this isn't it..

The scenes make absolutely no sense and the extras all seem to know they're extras, because they can't act, especially the ones where the moms are with their kids; it looked like were out shopping on a Saturday and were instantly begged to be in the movie.. The two sadistic brothers were as intimidating as Corey Haim and Corey Feldman... This movie isn't fun, campy or witty, it's sadistic, low budget and completely pointless.

I have totally hated every comical and silly troma film I have ever seen, and this film is very much like troma movies. Yet there were some interesting ideas in this film that I sometimes did like. But it got so rediculous and hokey that I simply couldn't take it anymore. The movie is just a totally wierd ride that felt sci-fi. Sort of like Mad Max meets Japanese extreme novies. I don't agree with other who thought it was better than Planet Terror. That movie just seemed to have this classic grindhouse feel to it, while this one just felt cheap and totally silly.

But having watched two episodes of \"Last Man Standing\", the Burditt-created sitcom in which Tim Allen plays a sexist, homophobic, xenophobic sporting goods executive, I had the following thoughts:1)Allen\\'s character would probably be right in the \"Bitch Hunter\" target demo;2)\"Last Man Standing\" is Burditt participating in an elaborate practical joke to see how much of that ethos he can put into a network sitcom; or3)That \"30 Rock\" kept associating \"Bitch Hunter\" with Burditt was less a friendly joke than a veiled cry for help.Allen\\'s Mike Baxter has a cliched sitcom wife - always rolling her eyes at his foolishness but ultimately going along - named Vanessa, a trio of daughters and a job at Outdoor Man, a sporting goods company defined for so long by Mike\\'s real baby: a catalog featuring photos of outdoor men doing manly outdoor things in exotic locales. But as boss Ed points out, not enough people read catalogs anymore, so Mike\\'s globe-trotting lifestyle gets grounded while he tries to fix the company\\'s terrible website - and so he can realize how much his girls need a man around the house.The youngest of them is played by Kaitlyn Dever, who was so incredible last season as the orphaned Loretta on \"Justified.\" I know work is work, but it\\'s  disheartening to see her here.Mike\\'s a guy\\'s guy who has no idea what \"Glee\" or the Harry Potter books are, is happy to be at the office because, quote, \"it smells like balls in here,\" and seems convinced that his family in particular and the world in general are going to hell in a hand basket because there aren\\'t enough real men anymore.\"Men used to build cities just so we could burn them down!\" he rants during a webcast that unexpectedly turns into a viral sensation. \"You can\\'t even change a tire! A tire! Why don\\'t you get off the couch, you moron, and go outside!?!?\"Other jokes involve Mike being uncomfortable about other cultures, gay people and immigrants, among others.Allen played a similar character on \"Home Improvement,\" and while I was never a big fan of that show, I don\\'t remember Tim Taylor ever being this abrasive. I didn\\'t like Tim Taylor, but I didn\\'t instantly hate him the way I do within 90 seconds or so of being with Mike Baxter.And there\\'s humor to be mined from a prejudiced and/or reactionary character. See Archie Bunker, most famously, or Stacy Keach on \"Titus,\" or even much of what Burditt and company had Jack Donaghy say and do on \"30 Rock.\" But those shows told those jokes with more style, and usually had an awareness of the ludicrous and/or offensive nature of those characters\\' words and deeds. \"Last Man Standing\" doesn\\'t.Allen\\'s a comedy professional, beloved sitcom star and the voice of Buzz Lightyear. These are all things that would lead me to assume that the studio audience - a species that tends to be generous with their laughter, anyway, by virtue of being physically present and encouraged by the warm-up guy - would enthusiastically respond to all of these groaners. Yet the episodes ABC made so far were clearly done before the laugh track was sweetened - a common industry practice where the studio audience\\'s laughter is augmented with pre-recorded laughs from older sitcoms - and you can hear crickets most of the time.\"Last Man Standing\" is the first of three new ABC comedies in which men struggle with what it means to be men in a world dominated by women. Each of them - \"Man Up!\" and \"Work It\" are the others - are terrible in their own way, but given the presence of Burditt behind the camera, and Allen in front of it, the cringe-inducing badness of this one feels the most frustrating.Unless, again, the whole thing is a very expensive, well-disguised prank.', \"I have delayed writing this review to let my pique cool somewhat.

David Caruso would look like a wrinkled grandfather if Blu-Ray did a high-resolution close-up on his face; and Emily Procter is also getting up there in years.  I suspect a state-of-the-art optical lens during shooting supplies just the right blur for the Blu-Ray discs to obscure the age of the stars, knocking the actual viewing experience back down into the DVD realm; but the studio can't ship the exact same viewing experience on both DVD and Blu-Ray discs, so the studio adds an additional digital blur to the DVD discs.Can you say, time for a Class Action Suit?@hg47\", 'Ok , so all the CSI sresies have wooden acting , dumb plots and poor writing .

He basically dismisses her and requests not to be videoed. He moves into his place and strange things slowly happen. He starts to get suspicious that people are out to get him and basically oust him from the apartment, either because they feel it is wrongfully his or some other reason. He makes noises and disrupts the other tenants in the building, constantly challenging him to quiet down. The chick he met on the street, for whatever reason she felt she needed to see him again, finds her way to the apartment. He lets her and have a wonderful dinner and commence whatever relationship with some nighttime love session. She gets up in the middle of the night to video tape his apartment and all the things in it. Then, what we dont see, she gets assaulted somehow. What was it? A ghost? Another person? We dont know what happens to her.Our mild-mannered tenant wakes up without really wondering what happened to her (or so it seemed). The whole \"who is there\" premise escalates to the level of paranoia as he traps himself in his apartment with handmade weapons and booby traps of his own making. He has like 12 days to establish himself as the official owner of the apartment and it took a matter of 12 days to become completely insane. Not sure that is likely, but that is what we have here. In the end, he is ultimately undone by his own boobytraps and dies by a wall of nails impaled upon himself.The epilogue: a small boy finds a laptop. Certainly, when we open anyone\\'s laptop we go right to the incriminating videos. Right? Happens all the time. So this little boy is watching and we see the previous tenant dragging the body of the chick, apparently he killed.

Which begs the question - is he a ghost or is it just done for effect? Probably the latter.

Stupid film.', 'Like many other long time X-Fans, I\\'m afraid I found this one an immense disappointment. I know it\\'s easy to fall into hyperbole, but in all honesty, this may well be the single most boring cartoon I\\'ve ever seen.On the plus side, on a purely technical level the animation is superb. About as subtle as a tattoo of a flaming skull, but technically superb. Oh, and almost all of the chicks are drawn with giant racks, too. And when I say \"giant\", I really do mean giant. The kind that in the real world could only be achieved with truly industrial quantities of silicone.Actually, aside from the fact that everyone keeps their clothes on, the style of animation here is very much in the mould of high-budget R-rated anime. I\\'m not just talking about the spandex-clad chests - there\\'s also the splatter and the gore. Measured purely in terms of screen time, the amount of violence in this show is probably about the same as you\\'d find in any other superhero cartoon. However, the feel and the texture of that violence is very different from what many viewers will be used to. There\\'s something positively gratuitous about the way it\\'s drawn. Indeed, it could almost be described as erotic... If that\\'s your thing.And yet, despite all the violence and the chicks with the giant racks, the truth is that this has to be one of the most profoundly boring pieces of television I\\'ve ever seen. The problem is... Well, let me explain with a story.I remember back when I was about seven years old and I thought Star Wars was the greatest movie ever made. I also thought that because the best parts of Star Wars were the space battles, wouldn\\'t Star Wars be even better if it was just one long space battle?Of course, I now know that it simply doesn\\'t work that way. However technically impressive, however visually awe-inspiring, those climactic battles only mean something when we\\'re emotionally invested in the characters. If we fundamentally just don\\'t care about Luke Skywalker or the world he inhabits, we also won\\'t care that much when - or indeed if - he blows up the Death Star. The special effects are reduced to being _just_ special effects. An impressive technical achievement to be sure, but nothing more than that.Unfortunately, that\\'s the way it is with this show.In this series, in place of real character development all we get are emotional histrionics. In place of real storytelling, scenes of gratuitous violence are interspersed with lengthy and turgid exposition. And in those very rare, brief moments when things aren\\'t gratuitously violent, histrionic, or even turgid, everyone suddenly becomes inanely bright and cheery for no apparent reason.The honest truth is that at no point did I find myself caring about the characters in this story even the tiniest little bit. The animators could have drawn us an episode in which every single one was fed slowly into a meat-grinder and it\\'d barely have rated a yawn.Frankly, I would just have found it as unutterably boring as every other episode in the series.Theo.', 'Great Cop show.

Stereotypes of coping with the girl's pregnancy and dragging her into the fray only to have her turn his life around. Usual stereotypes of dumb cops, double crosses and redemption. Actors were cast for their respective roles by looks and the robotic acting showed why, Twilight obsessed vamps notwithstanding.A bit concerned with the consistent and continual portrayal throughout the movie that lying, stealing, avoiding responsibility, drinking, bad parenting all were shown in a positive light while the cops come out as conniving drinking dumbasses.\", \"Tossing bits of formula storyline into a box and shaking it does not produce anything but jumbled stuff. Just a few examples follow even though the entire movie is poorly edited, directed and the acting came across as actors just acting the roles and not understanding the roles. This potpourri strains credulity which for this type of movie you have to have.(1.) Pointless most of the first half hour showcasing partying at a climbing lodge. Helicopter scenic shots of hills, birds and the usual vehicle on a road. Overbearing drum and piano pounding sound effects to create tension when the acting and story is flat.(2.) Lots of scenes of Scottish Highlands at camera angles that made hills look like mountains; streams look like white water rapids. Pointless time spent on a very small town pagan honorific festival with fireworks made to look like New York City July 4th, all through different angles of the same firework. Lots of scenes of climbing equipment being assembled with multiple camera angles; turning a 30' drop into one that looked much further.(3.) People seem to repeatedly always show up at the same location despite the remote isolation. The first was our climbing group coincidentally finding a girl buried underground in a forest with only a small breathing pipe. The second that two hunters happen to be in the same spot. Then two more just walk up at the same remote spot and kill those hunters. then these two always seem to show up at the same location as our climbing party which has now split into two groups going in different directions yet all three groups seem to show up at the same location. Clever editing, in this case, made instanteous space travel possible.(4.) Buried girl is a kidnapped Serb Croatian - of course, since that's a currently popular ethnic plot point in movies. How the girl looks clean and fresh after being buried for days and the 3 inches of forest ground cover above her box looks undisturbed is quite a burying trick. She could have just pushed the lid up.(5.) Same girl is swept downstream and ends up underwater for ten minutes yet is revived by just breathing into her lungs. Hello, she should be dead and besides her lungs should have had water in them which needed to be cleared out first. When she revives it's as if she's waking from a nap.(6.) Climber falls down a hill and severely breaks an arm but later he using it just fine, then he says it was his leg that's broken so then he starts limping even though he was running previously when it was suppose to be his arm.(7.) Female climber is upstairs in an apartment that's engulfed in flames. She passes out, but in the next scene firemen are carrying her away. Such fast firemen (more editing) yet when the gunmen (who again seem to always know where to be) are going through the town shooting anyone they don't like, the police are no where to be seen.The ending reflected the movie in that it made little sense and went nowhere.

Wow, and so healthy for you...  That\\'s when I realized the film maker wasn\\'t so much interested in spreading a message about how to get healthy eating as a vegan, but was more interested in proving that eating animal products was contributing to animal cruelty. Yeah, and don\\'t even get me started on all the soy crap they \"discover\". Soy is not a health food, people!!Personally, I already know all about how animals raised for food are treated. I read \"Diet For a New America\" many years ago and it totally opened my eyes. I was not interested in seeing that again. I understand that she wanted to prove a point, but I don\\'t like the idea of forcing people to see that sort of thing without a warning to begin with.

I just can't bring myself to understand why anyone, ANYONE, would think that that was a good idea.  As a film director, how can you justify building a suspenseful sequence around an animal of any sort, but especially a cat, making noise in a dark corner and then popping out just when you think you're about to see something really terrifying?  It's beyond my comprehension.That being said, a stupid scene like the one mentioned would not and should not be enough to entirely write off any horror film.  It happens so often in horror films that you'd basically have to write them all off.  What CAN cause you to write off a horror film would be the fact that it just isn't scary.  I'm struggling because I honestly can't decide whether or not this was supposed to be taken seriously.  Maybe this was supposed to be a comedy or a spoof, you know, like `Scary Movie', but I know that it's not and that makes me confused.  This has got to be one of the most unintentionally funny films I've ever seen.  Each scene looks like something out of a poorly crafted comedy.  It reminds me of when I saw `Darkness Falls' and I laughed throughout, which is not the reaction you want from a horror film.Clich&eacute;s abound in this messy film that centers on a haunted hotel that is going out of business.  The employees are obsessed with the rumors surrounding the ghost haunting the hotel and they do everything they can to stir stuff up.  God, none of this works.

Well, lots of newspaper clippings is a cheap storyteller and in this case it was newspaper clippings on a web page - shown over and over.(2.) Usual cheap prop of an army surplus recorder with analogue vu display to indicate some unknown sound. Duh, digital has been around for decades and, anyway, they have a limited frequency and amplitude range, so what's the point.(3.)

Usual, mysterious sounds - well, they are in an old hotel!(5.) The usual mysterious self-closing door. Actually, a prop person standing behind and pushing it. Scary!(6.) Lack of details such as why the two inn employees are there; why they are closing such a expensively appointed and well maintained inn. Their dialogue dominates the rest of the movie and although it started out interesting it simply got tiresome after 90 minutes.(7.) Usual chain locked cellar door.Spoiler follows:(8.)

Ti West is a master at creating atmosphere! If you didn\\'t like this movie, I\\'m sure Joel Schumacher will make a loud, angry horror movie one of these days! This is for TRUE fans of horror!\"These are just a few of the retorts you hear from fans when you complain about West\\'s slow-burn spookiness. I will grant, as others have done, that West does excellent work with a camera -- he frames and tracks some really sumptuous shots -- but atmosphere is no substitute for a story. I don\\'t watch movies for atmosphere. That\\'s why I buy lounge music, or candles, or fake cobwebs in October. If atmosphere is all a movie has going for it, then it\\'s no better than one of those looped images of flickering fireplaces you can pop on the TV during Christmas.So what about the story? Isn\\'t it scary? Nope. Two twenty-somethings -- Claire and Luke -- are the only staff members at the soon-to-close Yankee Pedlar Inn. With cheeky self-consciousness, they spend their many hours of free time searching the old hotel for one of the ghosts that is said to reside there. It\\'s a fairly standard ghost story trope, and the addition of a psychic who has \"reverse deja vu\" does little to twist the story into something intriguing or new. There is, essentially, no story, which was a similar flaw in the nearly identical West film, The House of the Devil (girl left alone for a long time, strange goings-on, some people are not who they claim to be, incredibly slow atmospheric build to a cheap-show ten minute conclusion of sloppily written \"chills\").So the story sucks. Movies can still succeed by virtue of the characters alone, even if the plot is confusing or sloppy. Unfortunately, Luke and Claire, while well-acted and realistic enough, are not interesting characters. They speak with the kind of canned dialogue that screenwriters pen when they aren\\'t sure what\\'s supposed to happen next in the film. Sara Paxton tries desperately to make Claire appear as cute as she can in every scene; she looks like she took acting lessons from a newborn puppy. On the very, very few moments when the movie lets the viewers glimpse something creepy, the effect is numbed by Claire\\'s mopey mugging.I\\'m certain it\\'s meant to be funny, as it is often accompanied by hokey sitcom music. West seems to be as confused by comedy as he is by horror, though. The movie thinks things are funny -- a girl in her underwear runs by a small boy! it takes Claire five minutes to take out the trash! the coffee girl is socially awkward! -- but even if they were, they contribute nothing to the story or the characters. All in all, it\\'s like watching two boring people making a movie about themselves being boring. Dull characters who are authentically acted are still dull.West obviously has an eye for making movies but not for telling stories. He tries too hard to be subtle and artistic. An excellent example is the final shot of the film. My friends did not understand why the camera held for so long on the final shot, but I saw what all of them missed. I won\\'t tell you what it is, but I will say this: if you don\\'t know it\\'s there, it\\'s almost impossible to see it. I only noticed the subtle little parting shot that West included in the scene because I read a review, like this one, telling me to look for it. And that\\'s the thing: if your artistry is so subtle, so careful, so minute as to escape the notice of nearly every single viewer of your film, then maybe you\\'re focused too much on the background stuff (like West\\'s highly touted skill at creating atmosphere) and not enough on the actual meat of your movie (characters, story, conflict).Dialogue that treads water. Dull and annoying characters. Almost no story to speak of. Cliched plot. More than your average number of fake scares (I counted three before the first fifteen minutes).

Kimberly Gabriel (Bridget McGrath in her first feature), an obstetrician, is haunted by her own inability to conceive. When maverick researcher Roger Gibson (Living Arrangements' Charles Hubbell) approaches her with a fat government contract and some snake oil about human cloning, she resists at first, but eventually sees the opportunity in light of her own ulterior motives. The obvious question becomes: how far will a woman go to have a baby?Then we skip forward seven years, and everything goes to hell. Earth is locked in the middle of a new ice age. The streets are dangerous, there is little food to go around, and Roger, Roger's sister, Kimberly, and Kimberly's son David are holed up in a small apartment, only going out when absolutely necessary to procure food. The entire remainder of the film takes place in that apartment.Sounds promising, no? And perhaps in the right hands, the final two-thirds of the movie could have been turned into the kind of tense sci-fi thriller that Vaughn Juares obviously intended this to be. But, and isn't there always a &#8220;but&#8221; after a statement like that?, it...isn't. I'm not entirely sure how to put this tactfully, so I'll go with &#8220;I'm not Jesus Mommy rivals The Room for moments of unintentional hilarity.&#8221;  One-room dramas live and die based on the quality of the actors involved, so the &#8220;some subpar acting&#8221; of the first third, which you can gloss over with everything else going on, takes center stage.  Add in a script that leaves out just a little too much to be impressionist and never avoids clich&eacute;&#8212;in fact, runs headlong into it as often as possible&#8212;and you've got something that ends up being a chore to sit through.

She is very pro-life and reluctantly accepts a position at a human clone project under Dr. Roger Gibson (Charles Hubbell). She steals a cloned embryo and implants it in herself.

This appears to be a \"come to Jesus film\" except the \"good guys\" do nothing heroic to save the day or themselves.

So to see Loki old and missing teeth is repulsive; and being so stereotypically evil is a sign of poor writing. Pass on this.

Here we have \"Dog\" and his minions prancing around in all their police/military style paraphernalia, followed by a TV crew and they are supposed to be \"sneaking up\" on some residence. Why not just get the local high school band out and really announce your presence in style? But then again, with the outfit Dog is wearing, perhaps the band would be wasted. Honestly, he looks like a worn out old guy who works Fremont Street in Vegas, charging for tourists to have their photograph taken with him.  Ok, so they find a car (a Sebring we are told many times) and we are besieged with shot after shot of each of the \"team\" in turn having a look through the car window. Now isn\\'t that really exciting?  And if we are not seeing shots of someone looking through the window of the car, we are continually confronted with shots of Dog\\'s wife\\'s legs and her stiletto shoes. Now that is not a pretty sight.Yes, I am sure (from reading some of the other reviews) that there are people who really like the show.  But from what I have seen, this program is certainly not \"reality\", it is definitely not entertainment and it is absolutely not worth watching.

The same reason I had to check why traffic is slowing down - to see the accident. Scenics awesome , at least on the episodes I had watched.

It started out good.  I was interested in what was going on.  Then something happened.  With every episode it got wortse and worse.  Let me tell you why.  First, every episode, a lawyer, his wife, lawyers brother and brothers girlfriend escape military trained killers.  EVERY time.  At first I thought, they couldn\\'t kill the people because they would get arrested.  Everyone would blame them.  But then I realized something.  No body execpt for about 5 people know what is gong on.  It\\'s not like thousands of people know who is after them.  They could go on the street, shoot them in the head and run.  No one would ever know who did it.  Another thing that bothered me was when the lawyers wife would go talk to his clients about their case.  Would never happen.  Something else that annoyed me was a few episodes ago.  They had the man behind the stuff, the judge saw things that showed he did it, then she said she couldn\\'t use it in cort because the lawyer acted as law.  Freaking crazy right?  Then the last episode, the way it ended made everything pointless.  It is as if they just said \"ok were done with this\" and ended it.  What a complete waste of time.  It\\'s not even worth watching the first episode.Oh, another thing, an episode comes on, builds up, up, up goes on commercial, comes back on and starts building up to something new.  It is crazy.  They need to build up the story through the episode and stick with one thing.  They never solve anthing.

Fast-forward fifteen years, and a group of high-school students, working on a project for their journalism class, are investigating the Diehl murders, headed by  Julian Miller (Purgatory House\\'s Johnny Pacar) and his girlfriend Riley (The Master\\'s Ambyr Childers). Julian enlists his stoner buddy Quinn (Black Swan\\'s Toby Hemingway) to \"acquire\" some information that only the local police have access to; Quinn has an in to the police department in the form of Detective Frank Lyons (Christian Slater), an ephebophilic detective who keeps Quinn rolling in dough--or illegally-swiped evidence on the Harlan Diehl case, it would seem--in exchange for hidden-camera nudie-cutie flicks of the local hot high school chicks. The problem is, when Quinn gets his hands on the tapes, he finds that Harlan Diehl\\'s legacy extends beyond the grave...If you haven\\'t figured out within ten minutes of this movie starting what happened to the baby from the opening sequence, you haven\\'t seen enough horror movies. That sort of predictability, unfortunately, plagues this entire production. Once you know all the principal high school students, you should be able to pause the film, sit down, and sketch out a list of who\\'s going to die when. And you know what? You\\'d probably be close enough to right to be extremely disappointed in this movie. And you have every right to be; Nickles, a character actor (probably best remembered for portraying Jim Morrison in Wayne\\'s World 2) who abandoned the screen to go behind the camera, does absolutely nothing to meddle with the formula. This is depressing, because given some of the angles this movie adopts (it would probably contain a host of minor spoilers to go into any detail, but I will say that my favorite character in the film, Wylie, portrayed by Galaxy Quest\\'s Darryl \"Chill\" Mitchell, is a video-store clerk and would-be film historian whom Julian finds himself consulting more and more as they get closer to uncovering the mystery of Harlan Diehl\\'s motivations), Nickels had ample opportunity to bend some corners, kick some sandcastles, what have you.

What is sad is that there is so much potential within the prose, and even the approach (restraint as opposed to abrasiveness) is welcomed and yet falls so flat it becomes tiresome.  The base plot feels almost silly, never really feeling like a genuine plot and more or less like a child's short story taken over by a screenwriter attempting to make it more adult themed.  The characters are skeletons, the revelations are minute and the overall impact is barely a scratch.  Dafoe sleeps through his performance and builds no depth between his character's motivations and his eventual arc, but at least Sam Neill and Frances O'Connor (she needs more roles) offer up some great supporting performances that actually build a backstory.  At the end of the day, two sharp performances and some beautiful scenery cannot a good film make.  This bore of a tale never fully gets off the ground, despite many attempts to do so.  I understand that this is a more internalized film, but there never seems to be enough reason to care much for what is unfolding.  At the end of the day, it says very little.

It's not hot or sexy, but if you want a sex scene, don't drag it out... 30 seconds would have done rather than the 5-plus minutes of amateur shots.-painting.  Lady, we get it, you paint.. and your paintings suck.-walking.  Lots of walking for no purpose.  In one scene, a stationary camera filmed the actress walking from one end of the apartment to the other... for 30 seconds.  No cuts, just one long shot.-lots of tv clips of interviews... this is a good 1/3 of the movie and serves no point what-so-ever.-going out on the balcony and looking meaningfully at the McDonald's across the street.-being shocked, absolutely shocked that you watched a person climb over a 4th story railing and jump off the building to their death... and then Dafoe, a few seconds too late yells out like he wanted to help him.  You watched him climb over the railing and said nothing.  Are we supposed to believe you didn't know he was going to jump?-Visiting friends who are partying.  One of the won't do drugs because he wants clarity for the end... are we supposed to believe that.-THE ABSOLUTE LACK OF ANY DISCERNABLE SCRIPT AT ALL.  Everything was ad-libbed with a general idea of what to talk about.. and it shows.  At least reality TV is fun and more scripted than this disaster.-Some asian kid delivers chinese take-out a mere few hours before the end of the world... why?  Like anybody would actually be working?-The movie is one long ad for Skype.I wanted EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER AND PERSON ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FILM TO DIE.  Even the ending was messed up as it took about 5 minutes to pass 2 minutes of time.... and the end of the world is a fade to white.  You don't even get to see these horrid actors burn which would have been the only redeeming characteristic of this travesty impersonating a film.I am shocked Willem Dafoe is in this.  Him having made this makes him clearly not Willem Dafriend as the movie and his performance clearly show no respect for writers, cinematographers, filmmakers, directors, actors, the audience, the popcorn guy, not even the cockroach that eats your dropped popcorn.

The script was terrible, character development poor, acting okay and there were NO special effects for an end of war movie.

Don't waste your money on this crap.\", 'I understand that \"iCarly\" is a wildly popular television series, so because of my negative criticism of its quality I will probably wind up receiving a number of negative votes from customers. But, as we start, I just would like to politely ask you to please read my full review first before deciding whether or not my critique was unhelpful.When this program first started, albeit it did generate a few chuckles (and at one point it left me laughing hysterically), for the most part I was not highly amused by it, and seeing as this is usually my sense of humor, I was confused as to why I simply did not find most of this entertaining. But as the years have passed by, I realized exactly why I was not amused: because it can be so amazingly hokey that it is a wonder as to why it grew to be so popular.And I realize that hearing about it may SOUND funny, and hearing about a few comedic elements featured in the series make it seem interesting, but to provide you with an example of what \"iCarly\" truly is like, I would like to ask you to think back to a moment where you tried a new food for the first time that you figured you would fall in love with or assumed would taste delicious, based on the fact that it looked delicious or that many people had described it to you as such before. Then when you actually sampled the dish for the first time, you found it so disgusting and foul that you couldn\\'t bear another spoonful of it, or, at first, you enjoyed it and kept going at it, but, little by little, you slowly and gradually started to realize how nasty it truly tasted and couldn\\'t handle it anymore. Or, maybe you just wanted to like it so badly that you had actually managed to convince yourself that you did, when in fact you did not at all or barely did. That is what \"iCarly\" feels like.Right away, someone may not realize the cheesy qualities of a majority of the jokes featured in this series. But, if you watch a few episodes and really focus on the little bits and pieces of dialogue and their content, you will slowly start to realize how corny it really is. Not to mention that the titular character possesses a few Mary Suish qualities; she is pretty, sweet, \"funny\" (or so the program labels her as) and normally does what is right, albeit she is still prone to a few bratty moments. Not to mention that she is the object of multiple infatuations amongst boys and gets good grades, and she lives a teeny-bopper\\'s dream life; raised by an eccentric (but annoyingly childish and dimwitted) older brother who is noteworthy for crafting the most idiotic art projects imaginable (a Christmas tree decorated with fake noses instead of ornaments, for example), grouchy, ill-tempered teachers who are so mean and furious and over-exaggerated that they can seem stupid at times, and so many over-the-top, unrealistic situation comedy storylines. There is constant shipping amongst characters (\"Team Edward\"/\"Team Jacob\"-type shipping) and the problem is that the main characters almost NEVER LOSE. I can remember at one point where they did, but that is just about it, unless you count the episodes where everyone loses but everything somehow manages to turn out sunshine and rainbows anyway. Carly always manages to come out on top at the end, never comically losing, really, of course everyone loves what she does and she always winds up winning, everything turns out right. I once heard a reviewer comment that the program serves as an escape for children from reality. Yeah, it does, for spoiled teeny-boppers who think that the world revolves around them. \"iCarly\" would not last a day if we were living in a world of children\\'s television of higher quality, mark my words. A lot of times, it\\'s so corny it sounds an awful like the deliberately-horrible attempts at making a cheesy situation comedy you may find people watching on other shows and being bored by. NICKELODEON IS SLOWLY EVOLVING INTO THE DISNEY CHANNEL! EVERYBODY RUN FOR YOUR LIVES!!', \"There are few touching moments in this film.  But you have to wait to find them.  It's the waiting part that ruins the film.  What I remember most is that none of the characters had any redeeming qualities.  They were all weak, is some way or another.\", 'I watched this as a Prime customer for free.  It was worth about half of that.  Very similar to stepping in dogcrap.  Now I have to go bathe.', '\"Meeting Evil\" is a movie of stupefying logic, inept writing, willful unpleasantry and a couple of good actors who are cashing checks and hoping no one sees them. To get through half the picture you will need to suspend your disbelief to the point of drooling in your popcorn. This is the sort of film recycled with parts from much better movies (Collateral, Kalifornia, Cape Fear, Jackson\\'s own Lakeview Terrace), so surprises aren\\'t exactly in store, the dialogue is painful to hear and the characters bear no resemblance what so ever to real people, they don\\'t even bear any resemblance to movie characters; for example their is a small child and her dog who stand in the same spot for what must be hours in movietime, and it is for no discernible reason. Who this film exists for could be a study unto itself, but anyone with a working braincell or any self respect need not apply. This is more along the lines of audiences who wish not to be entertained, perhaps have never seen a better movie, or just like to say that they have sat through a film of near unbearable pain and lived to tell about it.The plot has timed, mild mannered real estate agent John (Luke Wilson) having a real sad sack of a day, he lost his job, his mortgage is in foreclosure, he has a stack of bills that read \"past due\", and he fights with his wife (Leslie Bibb) for no particular reason. Then Richie (Samuel L. Jackson) enters his life, at first unassuming, but soon he reveals his very dark nature. Richie turns out to be a psychopath on a killing spree, a dozen in under an hour from my calculations, and he brings John unwittingly along for the ride. Richie\\'s motives seems to be nothing more than to turn John into a killer like him, or perhaps he believes it will turn him into a man like him. Obviously this will end up with John being mistakenly suspected of the crimes by the local inept authorities, of course it all ends at John\\'s house over dinner with Richie terrorizing the wife and kids.The film tries to work on a more psychological level, I guess, but it totally fails. The movie never actually explains any motives for the killing spree or any insight into the Jackson character, it seems as if he is supposed to be the embodiment of evil, possibly even the devil himself, but he is actually just a remorseless killer, or is he. The film leads to a dubious denouement, followed by a rather obvious cliched confrontation and then an unsatisfying anti-climax. This picture looks like it is under the inept impression that is supposed to be a character study, but it has no characters to study.Samuel L. Jackson is easily one of the best actors of his generation, but of late he has been stuck in something of a rut, he plays leads in terrible movies that go mostly unseen (The Cleaner, Unthinkable, Arena) and his successes of late have been cameos in superhero flicks. Here he plays a caricature of the Sam Jackson character, something else he has been doing a lot of lately, after just a few minutes of his shtick here the performance becomes unbearable to watch. Luke Wilson doesn\\'t fare much better, in fact he is unable to conceal his boredom with this trite, tedious material. But some of the supporting work is much worst, I suspect some of these \"actors\" were just friends, relatives, or investors. Supporting characters are portrayed even more dimly like the local police, embodied by Muse Watson as a cranky old veteran, and Tracie Thomas as his black stereotype female partner named Latisha.Directed by Chris Fisher, who adapted the screenplay from a novel by Thomas Berger (Little Big Man, Neighbors), I had never heard of this filmmaker before so I did a check on him over at IMDb, I soon discovered why I did not know him. Up to this point he has been known for directing some pretty poorly received direct-to-dvd potboilers, titles like \"S. Darko\", \"Street Kings 2: Motor City\", \"Dirty\", \"Nightstsalker\", \"Rampage: The Hillside Strangler Murders\". \"Meeting Evil\" is Fisher\\'s first theatrical film, well sort of, you see it\\'s premiering on cable/satelite TV and then video on demand, before receiving a belated theatrical release in a few theaters. I suspect the limited theatrical release is an attempt to help Jackson save face, but they shouldn\\'t have bothered, his career will be better served the sooner that this one is forgotten.I know, I know  if you can\\'t say anything nice, ...just one more thing, please. Add to this some of the most cloyingly pretentious cinematography, provided by Marvin V. Rush, a close collaborator on some of Fisher\\'s previously mentioned glories. Even at roughly ninety minutes \"Meeting Evil\" truly feels like an evening of unbearable torture. Yes, I believe that this the definition of torture porn.', \"This has been done so much better so many times .... both in books and film that I found it to be quite dull and predictable.  Characters are stereotypes.  I don't know who to blame -- producer?  writer?  director?  I watched 30 minutes then skipped to the end to see if I had figured out who did it  -- I had, but anyone familiar with the genre would do the same.\", 'This was really disappointing.  As a long time Spiderman fan this show comes off as silly, and targeted at the youngest of children.', \"and spiderman uses it like a toy and that's even the name of the episode like a toy..love to be able to watching it for free on Netflix, but very disappointed that I had to pay to watch it on amazon when I can watch it for free on Netflix, thanks again amazon for being to tricky sneaky and cheap\", 'I love this series and am a big fan but.....Giant robots???

If there were, I would.If you are the kind of person who is easily offended or wants to slam an individual for having an opinion that doesn\\'t follow along with the masses, then don\\'t read this. There are other reviews better suited to you. DeeLam and Lee make excellent points for how great they feel the show is. If you want that, then I strongly recommend you go there.

I just think that attacking my opinion as if it were an academic point to be disputed with counter facts laced with subtle and not-so-subtle inferences and implications of my indignity, THAT I don\\'t care about.The review:1) Aang\\'s epic journey in the original show from the village of the Southern Water Tribe to the Fire Nation did not have to end with the defeat of the Fire Lord. There were lots of other aspects of this world and the personal development of the characters that could easily have carried a whole new story arc. Giving up on the characters felt like a betrayal. Why become invested in their story if you are just going to kill them off?2) The unresolved segue that ended the final season of The Last Airbender, Zuko\\'s hunt for his exiled mother, along with the mysterious fate of Jet, the budding romances of Aang and Katara, and Sokka and Suki, and even the fate of Azula and former Lord Ozai were all like an invitation to come back for the next season, a season that would never come.3) The Legend of Korra suffers from her status as the direct inheritor of the Avatar mantle rather than a third or fourth generation descendant. This first episode is where the protagonist is supposed to shine, but we are bogged down by repetitive info dumps about characters and plot lines from the original that, other than providing latent back story, have no place in Korra\\'s story. The problem is, the writers were apparently indebted to the fans of the original, and felt inclined to provide a brief synopsis of each element of The Last Airbender that would no longer play a part in this new tale. That was spread out ham-handedly over most of the show. It had the feel of a weak story picking at the bones of a once stronger carcass. If you don\\'t like that analogy, pick your own to suit.4) Aang earned his powers. He did not have to try terribly hard to gain the most potent, if basic, versions of the bending techniques, but when he failed to study he paid for it on several occasions. Korra was instantly given mastery of all the bending schools except Airbending. There is no room for growth if your protagonist is already a powerhouse. Characters who start off near the height of their glory are typically in tragedies, not adventure tales. If Korra is not learning, then she is just throwing around power with no relevance to her development, nor that of the story line. In fact, because she is so powerful, it makes her seem like a whiny brat when she can\\'t learn what she wants exactly when she wants. Her flight to the city is more like the running away tantrum of a baby than an heroic quest.No, Korra\\'s story did not need to follow Aang\\'s exactly, but she should not just have everything handed to her. If she had been a fourth generation decedent, that would have allowed her story to stand alone and would have better explained and justified the change in venue I make a point of next...5) The tech of the original show was driven specifically by the bending power of their creators. Firebenders were able to create heat to power the motors that drove their vehicles. Airbenders used kites to flit over the clouds. Waterbenders surrounded their communities in ice walls, and Earthbenders used stone to implement a mass-transit system for people and cargo. In fact, there was no significant socioeconomic development that did not have it\\'s innermost source in bending. There is a reason why we have the expression, \"necessity is the mother of invention\". If you do not need the improvement, it is unlikely that you will make strides to discover it.All of a sudden, Korra goes to Aang\\'s science city and finds microphones, televisions, cars, printing presses, guns, and all the other conveniences of modern society. Did everyone forget that Aang, Katara, and Sokka used to have to make camp complete with camp fires, bed rolls, and fish they had caught from a stream, as well as protect themselves with swords, boomerangs, and staves?Korra is not that old, and Aang did not appear to be that old when he died. This means that the society\\'s evolutionary jump happened in about a quarter of a lifetime. This would be the equivalent of going from the renaissance era to the late industrial era without any stop in between. Bending cannot account for that, especially when this society seems decidedly anti-bending. If the civilizations that came before Aang, all of which had bending powers, had not come up with this super society, how now brown cow? There were-what, 500 or so Avatars before Aang? None of those guys ever ignited a spontaneous information age.Was Aang secretly sporting a Stephen Hawking level intellect that we just did not know about? It makes no sense.6) These 5 points each have an individual negative impact on the texture of the episode, but when contrasted with the oddly exuberant viewpoints of the other reviewers of this episode make one final sixth point, a sort of conspiracy theorist\\'s coffee table distraction if you will. How do you make such a crap-tastic product and find yourself fully stocked with rave reviews? Well, corporations that create profiles on Facebook hire \"Facebook Developers\" to add 2 or 3 hundred thousand \"likes\" to their brands to increase faith in their products. To me, it seems like such a poor product as The Legend of Korra, Episode 1 generating such miraculous reviews is blatantly serendipitous. If you are the author of one of these reviews and take exception to this suggestion, it is merely that. I don\\'t care if it is true or not. I merely point all of this out to highlight the following advice:Think for yourself. Watch the episode with an open mind like I did. If you think it\\'s the best thing you ever saw, \"like\" it on facebook! If you think it sucked like I did, be careful should you place a review that states this. You may just be painting a target on your back, again, like I did. Don\\'t let people TELL you what to like, when to laugh, or to accept their hackneyed writing pell-mell.', 'I read the other reviews before writing my own.  The interesting thing is the case was solved.  It would be great if the episode was amended to include the rest of the case.  The &#34;psychics&#34; were basically dead wrong, and the police were right all along.

In my opinion I think this genre has run it\\'s course, it jumped the shark a Paranormal Activity or two back for me.  And I actually fully enjoyed the first Paranormal Activity as well as the underrated The Last Exorcism, at least until it\\'s cop out ending. I even value The Blair Witch Project, more when it was first released than I do today, but it delivered what it promised, which may not have been much, but it delivered none the less.The latest crop of this genre, has nothing new to offer, the only interest can possibly be from people who enjoy the tedium of watching people do tedious things. These movies pretty well offer no surprises, one character in this film even states that he had figured out what was going on the moment that they walked through the door, amen. The jolts come from the surprise sprung on the drowsy half asleep viewer who has an hour in come to except that nothing will happen. I have even fallen pray to that.So is this some deep rooted grudge that I hold against the whole genre that has me lambasting the new flick Apartment 143: not at all. This is a particularly bad example of an all ready dwindling genre that year after year continues to deliver ever further diminishing returns. Apartment 143 is the lamest, worst written and poorest acted that the genre has had to offer, yet.The story has three paranormal investigators, or more accurately as the syfy channel calls them, \"ghost hunters\" setting up cameras to help the White family find out who keeps ding dong ditching their front door. There are, of course, other signs of a ghostly haunting, the usual flickering lights, creaky sounds, prank phone calls, etc.The Whites it seems have suffered a lot lately, other than receiving disturbing phone calls from beyond, they have suffered a family tragedy. The mother of the family died in a car wreck, this leaves dad (Kai Lennox) distraught and guilt ridden, hot teenage daughter Catlin (Gina Mantegna) obnoxious and rebellious, and little Benny (Damian Roman) sad and talking to the ghosts that only he can see; sorry audience, guess we\\'re just left out again.We get to watch father-daughter squabbles, with them and others spouting dialogue that is way too stiff to be spoken by real people. Then something happens, nothing special, but it happened. Finally some pervasive scares scenes, usually punctuated by a shaky camera movement, so that we can\\'t really see anything, but know for sure that it is scary. This all goes on for an excruciating eighty minutes, but you will swear it was much longer. Oh, and the last shot is a total rip-off of the ending to the original Paranormal Activity.Found footage films try to follow in the noble foot steps of the great Val Lewton tradition by being about atmosphere and implication, well they can hope in one hand, and I will let you finish the metaphor. The only scares I get is when I realize that this is not the last of the genre, probably not even the worst: there is said to be a Christian themed film on the way about the horrors of finding some old VHS porno tapes, shriek. Well I guess there is an audience for it, at least we are past the torture porn cycle, but can someone please get back to making decent interesting horror films.Check out my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com', 'Enjoy the dinosaur picture on the cover as this movie is really aboutanoying people wich will bring you to tears.There is absolutely no good value comming from this movie.The whole movie is seen through a camcorder viewfinder, the the camera girlis very very very annoying....It made me very very happy to throw the disk in the garbage...as i donthave any enemies bad enought that i would give them this DVD.', \"This is another hand held camera, so it must be real film.

The upside?  The market continues to be flooded with good and ... erm ... let\\'s say \"less than good\" product, and that keeps the consumers coming back to the trough for yet another scare.  The downside?  Well, because the dynamics of producing even a modestly-thought-out idea, video store shelves are stacked with one forgettable piece of garbage after another.Don\\'t say I didn\\'t warn you.After killing a local businessman\\'s wife, a group of entry-level kidnappers nab his tween daughter to hold for $1 million ransom.  Hiding out in an abandoned school, the team of criminals is surprised when a blood-stained young woman stumbles into their hidey-hole ... with a maniacal axe-wielding killer in pursuit!  Forced to team up for safety, the criminals and the young woman realize they\\'re in the wrong place at the wrong time, and, unless they can cooperate, they\\'re bound to become the lunatic\\'s dinner ... or something.This is Dumb.  Yes, dumb.  With a capital `D.\\'(NOTE: unfortunately, there\\'s no way to review RITES without some spoilers, folks.  So if you want to know my final rating, then jump down to the last two paragraphs.  However, if you\\'re up for some laughs, then read on!)Writer/director Padraig Reynolds bears the distinction of shooting the most ill-prepared slasher script I\\'ve watched in decades.  To his credit, there\\'s some mythology here - apparently, the `barn creature\\' feasts only on the heads of five female victims once every first day of Spring, hence the title - though it makes absolutely no sense.  See, he has a keeper who - for reasons never made clear - catches the women for him.  The `barn creature\\' can\\'t do it himself (or herself?) because he\\'s kept locked in the cellar of a barn (?!?!) for the rest of the year.Not only that, but also the monster apparently has a fetish for munching only the heads of beauty pageant queens or other reasonably hot-looking women, though (again) we\\'re given no logical explanation for that, either.  Instead, each woman is hotter looking than the one before, and, no doubt, we can figure out the subsequent lookers\\' fates once we\\'ve seen `em.Not only that, but also this ritual - Reynolds calls them \"rites\" for a reason, kiddies - has been going on for 25 years ... and yet no one has ever come up with the idea to simply close shop, take your good-looking women and children, and leave town every March 21st in order to escape the ensuing annual bloodshed and mayhem.  Instead, the townies go about their business like nothing\\'s ever happened, and you can what happens from there.Not only that, but these characters aren\\'t fleshed out enough to be anything other than stock fodder for the maniac\\'s blade of choice in a script desperately in need of going under the knife.  There\\'s the bad criminal.  Then, there\\'s the criminal with a heart of gold who only has to take the law into his own hands because he\\'s $300,000 in debt.  There\\'s that guy\\'s good-looking girlfriend (can you guess her fate?).  Then there that guy\\'s mistake-prone brother (can you guess his fate?).Not only that, but, technically, the film stinks of amateurism.  Here\\'s a tip: when making a film with a handicam or steadycam or hand-held camera of any sort, it might actually serve the process to stand still every now and then.  I have nothing against the herky-jerky documentary look of filmmaking, but, when you do it in a slasher film, you\\'re constantly giving the audience the impression that you\\'re seeing things from the perspective of the killer.  When that ain\\'t the case, you\\'re confusing the story!  And to complicate matters further, the story goes from daylight to nighttime in the flick of a switch.  Literally!  Guy goes into the abandoned school, and it\\'s bright daylight; guy runs from abandoned school only moments later, and it\\'s the dark of night.  Really?  Plus, as long as I\\'m piling it on, do you know any abandoned and clearly condemned schoolhouses fully equipped with mood lighting only?  I mean, maybe that\\'s the reason that the schoolhouse was condemned, after all.  The school district should be ashamed of itself.To the film\\'s credit, it ends.  However, the way it ends, makes absolutely no sense, and I (seriously) laughed for about five minutes.  I guess when Padraig Reynolds says cut, his crew took him seriously.  Stay tuned after the credits, though, because there are a few seconds more that try to ratchet up a few more scares ... or was that a few more laughs?RITES OF SPRING is produced by IFC Midnight, Red Planet Entertainment and White Rock Lake Productions in association with Vigilante Entertainment.  DVD distribution is being handled by MPI Media Group.  The disc looks and sounds about as well as any scream flick probably can and should - not a bad thing, just nothing all that special.  A few sequences were poorly miked, but, when you\\'re making schlock-horror on a budget, you take what you get.  The disc comes with a commentary track and some pleasant enough behind-the-scenes materials, if you\\'re inclined to check `em out.  Again, nothing special, but it\\'s nice to see that the cast & crew put some thought into some aspects of their tale; it\\'s just too bad it wasn\\'t in the script.NOT REALLY RECOMMENDED unless you\\'re a glutton for punishment or in the mood for a cheap laugh.  It isn\\'t that RITES OF SPRING is poorly made.  To the contrary, the cast and crew do they best they can to muster a few scares along the way.  It\\'s just that so little of the script makes any coherent sense.  It\\'s as if writer/director Reynolds had an idea - one based on a regular diet of slash and gore - and then he ran with it.  And why not?  Horror pics of this nature nearly always turn a profit, if not a few stomachs.In the interests of fairness, the fine folks at MPI Media Group provided me with a DVD screener copy of RITES OF SPRING for the expressed purpose of completing this review.', \"There is way too much of an emphasis on Juliette's woes this season. If she were at least a mimimally competent actress it might work, but she's limited to one -- count 'em, one -- facial expression, and that's it. Furthermore, her face screams COSMETIC SURGERY and she looks fake. Her nose is too pinched, her lips are over-botoxed, her hairline is receding, she has an overbite for Christ's sake, and her arms are fat and doughy. It's impossible to take her seriously or care what happens to her. Nick and the rest of the crew make the show worthwhile. They ought to get rid of Juliette.\", 'have not reviewed season  2 am only in season 1 3rd episode and am enjoying it very much at this time.', 'On the front of the box it shows the main character \"Nick\" swinging an axe but it never happens in the show.  There is no axe.  It\\'s just a cheap marketing ploy.I wanted this show to be good but it is not. I saw season one and was bored and hoped it would get better but it never did.  Being a \"Grimm\" means you are related to the faerie tale author from long ago.  The only thing that separates a \"Grimm\" from a normal dude in the show is that they can see a wolf/ox/fly/lamb person and that\\'s it.  Strangely this seems to terrify creatures that can shape shift, heal, jump ten feet in the air and have claws and teeth.  It makes no sense.  It\\'s stupid.It makes no sense that the Grimms have not been all killed off by now.  They have a power that is problematic for beast people but not dangerous.  If you just look at the world like it is Grimms are no big deal but everyone seems to think they are because of the writing that has no basis on logic at all.(spoilers)OK well the whole Juliet amnesia thing gets dragged out more which is really really really boring.  Nick continues to act really wooden,  The partner who is a better actor does not get less air time than last season.  The Asian dude is still the plucky comic relief comic relief which is racist.  All the monsters are white people which is racist and their is a Mexican Banshee which is odd.The monsters are not all were farm animals this season which is better but actually less tied to actual Grimm faerie tales or legends of any kind.  I have no idea why the show is called Grimm.  I imagine there is a copy of Grimm\\'s Faerie Tales in the studio but I\\'ll bet it is dusty.There was a Minotaur (Greek) that turns into an Efreeti (Indian) but is played by an American white dude like 99% of every monster on the show, I mentioned the Mexican (Mexican/Spanish) Banshee (Irish), Naga (South Asian) biker dudes played by more American white dudes. Actually all the monsters are basically played by white people from America or Canada which makes no sense what so ever.None of the plot arks ever unfold into anything interesting.

I had remembered what I had read about detective techniques in 1880's London. They basically did nothing that was shown on the show, and this takes place in the 1860's. Other things just made me roll my eyes. It reminded me of how lazy Detroit 187 was. They hired Michael Imperioli to play a detective in Detroit and even had him asking his coworkers if they wanted to get a slice. Facepalm!

This was the Victorian period...ladies did NOT mingle with prostitutes. Do the writers seriously not know this??? I thought this show was trying to be historically accurate.And the women\\'s dresses in this episode were atrocious. I noticed how ugly they were in previous episodes, but I was willing to overlook that, until this episode. A very recent widow--who should still be in mourning, I don\\'t care who she thinks she is, or how open-minded she is--would NEVER show herself in public in a WHITE ballgown! Are you kidding me???  Who is the costumer on this show? Not only was it white, but it looked like a wedding gown...HELLO!!  Again, who is dressing these people?!! I guess I\\'m just used to the higher quality and attention to detail I see on other BBC shows like Downton Abbey, for example. I\\'ve never seen such deplorable costumes on a BBC show in this century! And don\\'t try to argue there was a war going on. This was the North, and these people are supposed to be VERY wealthy. They can afford the best silks and satins, etc. So the women should be dressed to fit their station. They don\\'t seem to have a problem dressing the wh@res to look like wh@res...why can\\'t they dress the upper class characters correctly?I could have overlooked these seemingly minor details except it seems as if great pains have been taken with the rest of the show to make it as accurate as possible, so the whole costume debacle is just sad, bad, and beyond my comprehension.Then there\\'s the awful acting, that I won\\'t even go into.The first several episodes were interesting, but once the bad acting became too much to bear any longer, and the hideous costumes made my eyes bleed with their ugliness, I had to stop watching. If this show gets another season, I hope they get a bigger budget and can afford some better costumes and more talented actors.', \"How could the BBC and HBO do such a poor job?

Story was loose, characters not believable, relationship to boy hooker domineering, and just...wish I hadn't paid the two bucks to see it.\", 'What a mess. First-time feature director and screenwriter Leslye Headland goes for the jugular in this 2012 black comedy which takes the same cues as 2011\\'s megahitBridesmaidsdoes but frankly doesn\\'t take them far enough to be remotely funny. In fact, I laughed only once during the film\\'s 91-minute running time (it was the line about Michael Jackson). That\\'s too bad because producers Will Ferrell and Adam McKay were able to recruit a first-class cast and then unfortunately lets Headland flounder with a predictably belabored situation, leaden pacing, and gags that are overly deliberate in execution. The threadbare plot focuses on a dysfunctional trio of obnoxious girlfriends who gather together &agrave; laThe Hangoverfor a hedonistic night of celebration before their friend\\'s big wedding. The bride-to-be is Becky, a former geek whom the trio viciously called \"Pig Face\" in high school behind her back. Now hitting thirty and finding their lives disappointing to say the least, the girlfriends are horrified to be beaten to the altar by someone they treated as a mascot to make themselves feel better.The alpha leader is Regan, the overachieving maid of honor known appropriately as the Hannibal Lecter of bridesmaids. Although resentful of Becky\\'s happiness, she is determined to make sure the wedding goes off without a hitch, a challenge given that she inadvertently ripped Becky\\'s wedding dress during a drunken binge with bubble-headed Katie and perennial party girl Gena. The three women desperately figure out how to fix the dress in the middle of the night as they cavort with the various groomsmen out on their own bachelor party. So many moments ring false including the set-up and the lightning-flash changes in the characters just to service the plot, but at least the cast is game. Fresh from playing the understandably depressed bride inMelancholia, Kirsten Dunst appears to savor her mean-girl turn as Regan with surprising acuity and fearlessness. I give her credit for not being afraid to come across as unlikeable. Playing a more extreme version of the obsessed sister she played inWedding Crashers, Isla Fisher plays Katie with nervy comic abandon and obviously reflects her husband Sacha Baron Cohen\\'s go-for-broke influence.Starting with a scene on a plane with Horatio Sanz as she graphically describes how she gauges a certain act, Lizzy Caplan gets to play Gena as the tough-talking chick still aching for the boyfriend who abandoned her when she became pregnant. Adam Scott plays the boyfriend in his typically smarmy manner, while James Marsden gets to play his cynical character in the same vein as Regan\\'s foil. I was surprised to see Andrew Rannells, star of Broadway\\'sThe Book of Mormon, play Katie\\'s flamboyant co-worker and the party stripper. Rebel Wilson, who played Kristen Wiig\\'s brain-dead roommate inBridesmaids, has to play straight woman this time to the nasty trio as poor Becky, though she gets to have a few choice comic moments in the home stretch. Speaking of which, Headland cuts a lot of corners in the third act in a last-ditch effort to deepen the characters. It doesn\\'t really work since any goodwill the movie generated had long since evaporated by then. It\\'s no wonder this movie has shown up on Amazon Instant Video and Video on Demand a month before its theatrical release since word-of-mouth will likely sink the film\\'s chances at the box office. At least at home, the producers have gullible viewers like me who were willing to give it a try without leaving the couch, a big mistake on my part.', \"This movie has several quality actresses and a promising premise. The trailer suggested a funny movie similar to Bridesmaids, which I loved, so I was really looking forward to watching this. Unfortunately, the jokes fell flat and the characters were catty and unlikeable.

It features a powerhouse cast, including Kirsten Dunst, Rebel Wilson, Isla Fisher, and many other fairly well known actors/comedians. Sadly, the contents of the movie were more dismal than anything.If I had to sum up this movie, I would say it is a combination of the Hangover and American Pie minus the laughs. A pack of girlfriends from high school are reunited when one of them is engaged to be married (Rebel Wilson). Most of the story centers around the hours, and events, leading up to the wedding.The problems I had with this movie are many. First of all, Rebel Wilson, arguably the funniest of the bunch, is absent throughout roughly 90% of the movie. Maybe they should have had her switch roles with one of the other ladies and improvise a bit. Could have helped things ALOT! And I noticed they gave Horatio Sans a credit in the movie on the Amazon listing. He was in it for roughly a minute. It was much more a cameo than anything else.They joke around about doing coke. I'm rarely ever a fan of a movie that shows people using hard drugs, especially when they do not show the repercussions of such actions. This movie pokes fun of it! Truly poor taste!The three main characters are extremely flawed and do not learn from their behaviors. One is addicted to coke, one is a hardcore partier, and the third is a jealous type A personality with body issues. Despite all of their bad decisions and the horrible outcomes, at the end of the movie it isn't clear if any of them learned anything. The only one who might have learned something was the coke addict, but even this seemed unclear. To make matters worse, the hardcore partier almost dies from an overdose and they gloss over this fact. Seriously!? It seemed like the perfect point for her to turn her life around for the better. This movie missed a golden opportunity.Where does that leave this movie? Not funny with hardcore drug usage and characters who do not learn anything from their experience. In my opinion, this makes the movie a definite pass. You won't be missing anything, trust me!\", \"Happened upon this on Netflix.

What we have are a bunch of middle-aged guys (it\\'s never revealed, but you get the sense they\\'re anarchists) who, recorded (possibly accidentally) over one\\'s own personal sex tape, record their own dangerous misdeeds (including a force flash of a young lady). Well, after a brief discussion on how they get money on a porn site for every time they get a flash recorded, one of them tells the group how they can get more money than they could imagine from finding one certain tape. What\\'s on the tape? Why\\'s it worth so much? Who\\'s paying for it? Those and other questions get asked, but no real answers are given.What trace of a storyline there is in the central story, there\\'s little more than that in each ministory. Honestly, it felt like the dialogue in each story had been crafted by college kids that didn\\'t care about coming up with an intelligent (let alone intelligible) storyline, they just wrote what they felt like then added special effects to make it all fit. Not only excessive swearing (already making it too much like today\\'s American horror rather than a substantial foreign horror movie), but also (in most cases) having excessive nudity (I think they only added horror elements to keep it from being labeled as \"porn\"), it already made me anxious to actually want something substantial.Well, I would rate something like this 1/2 a star rather than none at all simply for nostalgia (they did get V/H/S technicalities and tape quirks right, I\\'ll give them that), but I\\'ll slightly further than that.

Three observations:First: no doc would allow someone who needed surgery as urgently as the Parenthood character is alleged to have needed it to wait for weeks to have the surgery.  It's called 'malpractice,' and for good reason: if a cancer is thought to be so urgent as to require surgery, it's medically ill-advised to wait.Second:  no one who has been through chemo is doing splits at a bar a few weeks later.  Or only BEGINNING to lose a little hair.  Someone who has been through chemo is obviously and visibly pale, weak, and bruised, and looses hair (if she is going to) much more dramatically.Third: going through surgery, chemo, and radiation--which the Parenthood character is alleged to have to go through--takes an enormous toll.  Most people--even young, otherwise healthy, and clearly very affluent--people who have been down that path LOOK it, for months, and possibly forever, moreover, since you are leaving with a weakened immune system after cancer treatment, you are much more vulnerable.It's a huge disservice to the many women (and some men!) who have gone through breast cancer treatment to make it look as manageable as the show does. Even when there are not emergencies--as often there are not--cancer treatment is a slog, a struggle, and it marks you for life.I understand that television glamorizes/misrepresents most of the difficult things in life. Pretend that the characters could afford to live as lavishly as they do in Berkeley  (if the parents' house/compound were in Berkeley--which is it not--it would be worth many millions of dollars).  Pretend that normal working people and parents have the sort of time and money to do overnights in expensive hotels, wear fabulous clothes, constantly have parties with snazzy gifts, etc.  That's just standard Hollywood fare; no one is really fooled.But DO NOT MISREPRESENT WHAT CANCER TREATMENT REQUIRES, or WHAT IT IS LIKE TO GO THROUGH/HAVE GONE THROUGH IT.

Not to mention the video itself, though described in the beginning to be top-of-the-line in all its features, kept having cliched glitches yet no explanation as to why they kept happening (I doubt cameras detect human tension and therefore constantly screw up their own quality in the process).I hope IFC doesn't keep letting people repeat this type of movie mistake.\", 'this was quite possibly the most annoying movie ever.\"Dumb\" is too smart for this movie!This movie makes the Blair Witch look like a 5 star movie!I actually wanted to put my head through a wall- that\\'s how stupid this movie is!80% of the movie is a camera being dragged through brush and trees.worst script logic ever!

Didn\\'t care what happened to him at all. And it turns out that his wife, played by Susan Sarandon, was just as bad.

So why in the world would she be in an ill-fitting ugly cheap dress that looked like a 1980s prom gown?Why do I care about the dress?

I never come up with a good answer to the question (and I'm never lucid long enough to go digging, really). Case in point: the found-footage film, an offpsring of the mockumentary that is, ultimately, an offshoot of the popularity of 1999's The Blair Witch Project. I've seen maybe a half-dozen found-footage films I would consider watching a second time; I've seen maybe one hundred found footage films overall. Hollow is not only not one of the half-dozen, it's a movie I would consider using as an instrument of torture were I a guard at the Salt Pit. Pointless, plotless, presumably scriptless nonsense that almost dares the viewer to keep watching to see how much worse things are going to get. Guess what? The answer is &#8220;a lot&#8221;.Plot: Two couples are on vacation on the English moors. Okay, maybe not moors. But that sound spookier. It's actually quite dry for England. And maybe not vacation, either; they've come to sort out a dead relative's estate. Dead relative is a priest, and estate is... an old abbey? I think it was an old abbey. While they're on their way there, they pass a big old gnarled tree, and Emma (Emily Plumtree in her first feature appearance) relates the story of how the tree is possessed blah blah. Emma, her beau James (The Task's Sam Stockman), and their pals Lynne (Get Him to the Greek's Jessica Ellerby) and Scott (Devil's Pass' Matt Stokoe&#8212;no relation to the writer, at least I fervently hope not), arrive at the old pile and spend a few entirely uninteresting days trying to keep a clich&eacute;d script afloat (predictable sexual tension between non-couple pieces, growing obsession with the tree, things that go bump in the night) before, of course, they must all go confront the tree and find out if it's really possessed or if the scriptwriters were just ripping off The Blair Witch Project.You get all the usual lowlights from a movie like this, people running around and screaming incoherently, usually off-camera, while something that you never quite get to see is chasing them. Now, I am a big, big fan of not revealing the monster; the one scene I didn't like in Cloverfield (and yes, I do realize I am the only person who really liked that movie, shut up about it) is the one Big Reveal scene at the end that's there solely to stop the masses complaining that you never get to see the monster. (Compare with the excellent scene in Val Lewton's Cat People in Central Park, where you get a few glimpses of shadow at best; it is a textbook in how to create suspense.) So when I'm complaining about it, you know you've got problems. Much of the problem has to do with the fact that, during the action scenes, we're not really seeing much of the characters, either; Axelgaard seems to have decided that the movie would be more suspenseful if you couldn't see the characters or the thing chasing them. Not a bad experiment, but he probably should have changed direction once he realized how incredibly stupid it ends up looking. You, too, would be better served by avoiding such.

Best of all, we don't need to feel even a pinch of remorse because - now this is the Really Good Part, honest - the victims are already dead! What could be better than that?? Needless to say the acting is average, the script is wooden, the plot is essentially non-existent, and the verisimilitude likewise missing in action.But, if you are in need of an effective diet plan then apparently being turned into a zombie is just what you are looking for, because although the series is set in & around Atlanta GA where 86% of the population is either fat or morbidly obese, everyone in this series is straight out of Central Casting Los Angeles.

Now we have the worst horror-movie cliche, a \"heroine\" who will be fine if she just hurries up, but she takes her time to indulge in maudlin dramatics and gets...eaten. We don\\'t care about Andrea anyway, because Laurie Holden\\'s trout pout is too hard to look at, and her character\\'s predicaments are all the result of simple stupidity: she just can\\'t see that the Governor is a homicidal sociopath, even though it\\'s obvious to everyone else. We, the audience, keep seeing things before she does, and then we\\'re supposed to endure her endless obtuseness and still cheer for her! In this latest example, Andrea is locked and bound in a room with Milton, the Governor\\'s assistant who is about to die and turn, and then will try to eat Andrea. Milton, still barely alive, urges Andrea to hurry up and use the pliers he left at her feet to free herself, so she can mercy-kill him and escape, before the Governor returns with his strike force. There is every reason here for extreme speed. Death sits across the room from her and the Governor cannot be far behind. Never was it more important to keep one\\'s mind on the task at hand (freeing oneself) and get the hell out of dodge. All Andrea has to do is hurry. But she indulges in long, tragic looks, tries to philosophize with Milton, forms dreamily optimistic facial expressions, and thus fritters away the time she needs to survive. So of course, Zombie Milton gets her. But there is no meaning to it, because she LET it happen! Then we have some more drawn-out tragic posturing when Rick and the gang arrive to find her all bitten open and about to die. Sad music, long stares, reverence. And we\\'re supposed to see her as the \"Noble Soul who only wanted people to live\". Walking Dead is starting to get Smallville Disease, where the characters spend all their time bloviating about the Deep Inspiring Meaning of what is happening, but there is no story.

Cristina mentioned once that animals were coming for Lexie, but how did they keep the animals away from her?  I've loved this show from the beginning, but this season is one HUGE letdown so far.

Walter Bishop is at his most annoying and boring.  Peter and Olivia are weak and ineffective. The big reveal takes so long and, really, in the end, so little is revealed, you just want it to be over.  With respect to Walter Bishop's acid trip?  Trust me, there is nothing more boring than someone else's acid trip. Walter's acid trip is no exception. I think Disney should sue them for using a very recognizably disneyesque animated fairy. And then there's the Monte Python animation sequence.Aimless, drawn out plot developments. Everything that usually makes a Fringe episode exciting or interesting is eliminated. It's claustrophobic. Absolutely minimal forward plot movement. Forgettable dialogue. No suspense.  One scene of pointless and unconvincing violence. Utter absence of interesting supportive characters. Rehash upon rehash. No new ideas - zero. Utter lack of wit or humor. And on and on. And the director seems to take delight in sapping whatever life there is in this sorry script with excruciatingly slow pacing.  Everything that can be wrong with a TV episode is wrong with this one. It's enough to make you dread the next episode.  Right now, it looks like the season is going nowhere.  Or the show's creators have no idea what to do with the plot and don't really seem to care.\", \"I totally loved this show in the first two seasons... then I sloughed through BORING season 3... got better in season 4, and I started dreading the end of the show this season.  The season started out a little boring, but it got better quickly.  I put off watching the last 2 episodes because I was dreading the fact that it was going to be over.  I waited so long that I was able to watch the last 2 episodes back-to-back, fortunately!  The 2nd to last ep. was amazing, and the last one started out that way, too. But - and I won't give anything away, it ended VERY badly.  Too many shows end badly, but generally it's because they didn't know they were going to end.  THIS show knew it was ending, and they could have done a much better job of it for sure.  IMHO, the last episode ruined the show for me.  It was so disappointing that now I don't even care that the show ended, and that is just sad.  It's better for shows to go out on a high note so that people will miss the show, not be happy it's over.  Shoot.\", \"I can't believe I forced myself to finish the first season's 13 shows.  I think it was the fascination of just how terrible this series is in so many ways that it's amazing and drove me here to write a review.  Where to begin?  How about the cast and acting?  Where in h#@@ (pun intended) did they get these actors from - some community college acting class?  Except for Terry O', the acting was beyond awful.  And so badly cast that it made me laugh out loud several times.  Then there's the writing; wow, I don't recall hearing such mundane lines in a long time.  Actors walk into a room several times and ask, &#34;What are you doing?&#34;  What are you watching?&#34;  Are you kidding me?  There's no other way to evoke curiosity?  The sets were so fake, it was fascinating.  And if you are going to use CGI badly, don't use it at all.

I was bored through all of it! Stupid, pathetic, shameless movie! That is all I have to say. Nice attempt to make money! Now I would like to get payed for watching this garbage!\", '(Warning, this review contains some spoilers)I thought the first would help the producers realize their mistakes and improve on them. Fat chance.The initial shot has people raving about Grave Encounters and going loco about how good or bad it was and how some were convinced it really was real. One such raving fan goes to an alcohol-steeped party and (eventually) reveals that he\\'s a @#%^#@$ visionary. My thought on that was \"Sure you\\'re a visionary. I don\\'t get your vision, though.\"His plan is to provide evidence that Grave Encounters was the true deal. Problem is... his obsession with the \"proof\" leads to problems with his girlfriend, friends, and, really, his whole life situation it seems. Between his own filmmaking (you\\'re given snippets of his film, which is nothing but predictable shot after predictable shot) and finding what he needs, he\\'s really letting himself loose on his psychosis.Just like in the first film, this goes to show you NEED to know how to make your ghost effects realistic. There was one singular shot where a creepy ghost did send chills down my spine. Then the ghost moved. End of the fear and the beginning of my eyes rolling.If there\\'s anything I can say this movie did that did get my interest, it was the use of multiple types of cameras (iPhone, professional camera, B/W silent-era camera, etc.) to tell the story from different types of angles and get a sense of realism.The other was the return of a certain character from the first movie. Out of all the actors in this movie, his was hands-down the most believable. Pure craziness, from the shocking reveal to his last moment.Unfortunately, afterwards, it\\'s all hedonism at its most horrorific. And it quickly got as disinteresting, bland, 1-dimensional, lackluster boring as it had been. Even when a cleaning lady is passing by the ghost hunting team, I\\'m quite certain the team didn\\'t notice the look she gave them, which tipped off that something was going to happen. Before the elevator doors opened, I (unfortunately again) could predict what would happen. It defied physics, but it couldn\\'t defy predictability? When will filmmakers today learn?Overall, despite the nice maneuver of using multiple cameras to some advantage and one character being believably looney, I only give this 1/5.', \"I absolutely loved GRAVE ENCOUNTERS. I would place it high in the ranks of my films that came out the year it was released and include it in my list of top notch horror films of all times. For me it hit every note exactly right. Not so with the follow up film which fails more often than it succeeds, the usual problem with most sequels.If you haven't seen the original it revolves around a ghost hunters' type program that we find is more staged than reality. In that film the terror rises when they discover that the ghost are indeed real and that they prevent the crew from ever leaving unless they're placed in a body bag. It offered some truly scary moments and a general sense of unease that prevailed from start to finish.The reason for its failure can be seen in the majority of the opening sequence which takes up perhaps the first half of the film. Instead of a professional crew we have a student film maker who along with his friends spends most of his time getting drunk and trying to have sex. When he begins to look into the disappearance of the original crew he eventually talks his group into seeking out the abandoned hospital and investigating it on their own. The problem is that the majority of film time here involves them partying and swearing like sailors as opposed to furthering the story along. The whole opening segment feels like wasted film and time and something to just fill out the story instead of add to it.When the group finally gets to the hospital they're confronted by a guard who prevents them from entering. But this is a determined group and they eventually find their way in. When the guard enters to pull them out things begin to happen starting with the guard's death. Frightened and unable to leave, the group searches for a way out just like their predecessors did. It's not until later in the film that they stumble across the sole survivor of the original film, the host of the show, who has been trapped here for years. Can they escape with his help even though he hasn't been able to all this time?That's the sort of stupid question that comes up in this film. The scares that we see are this time around more predictable than the first time even though there are some creepy moments to be seen. But the sense of discovery found the first time around is lacking this time and the whole initial sequences do nothing but make you want to reach for the fast forward button rather than wait until something happens.I don't think I can even give this film an A for effort since it seems like so little effort went into making this a good picture. It feels like someone realized they had a cult hit on their hands and decided to keep the ball rolling rather than take the time to add something to the story. Sure the part with the old host adds something but at the sake of dead air time (no pun intended) prior it isn't worth it. Sorry but I can't recommend this movie to anyone, including fans of the first film.\", 'This movie is really bad.  Not funny in the least.  A total waste of time. So sorry I rented it.', 'Extremely poorly written. I found the jokes more disturbing then sad as the movie progressed. This is a very adult film, not something any age kid should be watching. From the hardcore porn playing in the backround, to the full frontal nudity. Somehow watching a old guy getting blown up with all the kids watching was supposed to be funny.I found my self feeling bad for the kids being in a film like this.They take the shock value we see in movies like, wedding crashers oldschool and dodgeball. Then they put it in a movie with a bunch of little kids. Instead of adding in some funny inendo, or word plays, like the other films. They show hardcore porn, nudity, and really disturbing behavior.There is a line between funny, and WTF.

I had no expectations of what this movie was or what it could be, but I took a chance on it and wish I could get a refund.  It was terrible.  There's no real mystery to this as you should be able to figure out what happens in the first ten minutes.  It's very obvious what's going on.The first 30 minutes or so are somewhat interesting, as this uncomfortable feeling builds at a dinner party that only one side of the table wanted to happen...and then you start to wonder how the other people are going to get out of the bad situation.  I laughed because it reminded me a little of holiday meals with relatives I don't like and who I wish would leave...but they can't take the hint.By the 46 minute mark I just gave up on the movie and realized this was one I'd have to sit through and endure until it was over because I spent the $9.99 on it and I just can't turn it off and not see the rest of it.This is the kind of movie that ends up playing very late at night on a random cable channel and is only watched by people who have nothing else to do and can't get to sleep.  I would never recommend this to anyone...definitely don't waste money on it and don't believe the reviewers who are giving it 5-stars and saying it is the best thing ever.I fell for that scam this time.

The writing was very poor, and the failed attempt to be funny was all put into the plot.  Comedy is always funniest when it's character driven as much of the earlier episodes are. In addition to the poor writing, the episode is dragged down by the dead weight that goes by the name of DeVito.  Compare any episode of Season 1 (which was blessedly DeVito-free) to any subsequent episode you wish and the season 1 episode comes out on top. The cast (minus Dead Weight DeVito) is extremely talented and their creation of season 1 was fresh with a Gen-X sarcasm, and consistently laugh out loud funny. In that first year, Glenn Howerton can make you laugh with a mere look in close up. But with season two came the addition of Dead Weight Devito, whose comedy is tired old-school broad sitcom comedy. It doesn't match the sensibility of the other four actors or their characters and the longer the series went on with DeVito, the more it sunk towards his sitcom level. This episode hits that rock bottom.\", \"I watched the whole season and wished I hadn't. The mom drama is disgusting and judges are idiotic.

It is a non-stop series of scenes depicting humiliation, gratuitous cruelty and violence, outright torture, sadism, bondage and obedience, degrading and violent sexuality, simple ghoulishness, and on and on. I find nothing redeeming in this series. There is nothing in it I would call a plot or a narrative arc or character development.  Any more than there is in your average porno production.  Just a pretext for more \"torture porn.\"There is no wit or humor or depth or insight, either.  It is just relentlessly and oppressively cruel.The fact that it has so many positive reviews tells me that it has found a cult following - not that it actually deserves positive reviews.I think the actors in this series are not only wasted. I think they are degrading themselves and damaging their reputations by participating in the project. I will never be able to watch Jessica Lang, James Cromwell, Evan Peters or any of the other actors without unfortunate flashbacks to this series.

That\\'s about it.  There is no plot and there are no characters.OK, there are a few characters.  Kristen Connolly (\"Cabin in the Woods\") plays a reporter who is making a documentary about a disastrous plague that infected a small coastal town in Maryland.  It\\'s her voice you hear doing voiceovers, and she\\'s the one pulling all the different film clips together from material confiscated by the government.  Frank Deal plays Mayor John Stockman, who was told about the toxicity in the bay but refused to do anything (he\\'s pretty much a retread of the mayor in JAWS who wouldn\\'t close the beaches because he was worried about the tourist trade).  Then there are a bunch of characters called \"Victim #1,\" \"Fair Man,\" \"Activist,\" \"Middle Aged Supporter,\" and \"Bob.\"  I don\\'t remember any of them individually.  But who cares?The plot can be summed up as follows:  The water in the bay is toxic because the mayor allowed chicken processing companies to dump their waste into it, which created mutant parasites, which infected the fish, which infected the people, who are now all developing grotesque blisters and lesions and generally going berserk.  We see a couple of so-called \"research scientists\" doing ridiculous experiments like looking inside a fish\\'s mouth with a flashlight (aha! Parasites in there!).  Doctors speak like high school students.  People run around bleeding and screaming and throwing up.  And Kristen Connolly tries to be all serious as she comments on all this like it\\'s really, really happening.THE BAY is a low budget parody of CONTAGION (which also suffered from too little characterization).  I have no clue why critics gave this film positive reviews - I guess they enjoyed the \"found footage\" technique far more than I did (if I never see a \"found footage\" film again, it will be too soon!).

However, the manner in which the footage is tied together is so random that you could die from a seizure in the theater.The problem of this film is the collection of situations and actions in those situations that make up this movie as a whole. Literally every scene is worth a serious face palm. The film starts with a random (and way to long) low quality introduction of the setting, followed by a first victim of the parasite, and it goes down from there. There are scientists that find weird unexplainable parasites and jump into the water to take a look. There are two befriended police officers that come across a house with screaming people, one goes into the house with his gun drawn, the other stays in the car with his seat belt on. There is an agency that specializes in outbreaks (viral, bacterial.. whatever) and does not seem to give a damn when they hear about the mysterious issue\\'s in the town. There is a supposedly intelligent couple (dentist & lawyer) that walk into a ghost town filled with dead bodies near the end of the film.. with their few months old baby.. and the guy actually thinks what he sees is funny!? The list goes on and on.. 2 hours of this crapThen there is the science.. like the only other review I could relate with pointed out. The science is made up by a 5 year old. All conclusions that are drawn, numbers that are given, idea\\'s that are thought of.. it is terribly. Just when you hear something that might be vaguely plausible or logical. i.e. the explanation that anomalies could come from pesticides.. nuclear leaks are drawn into the equation to make it sound better or whatever.. Everything about it is pretty pathetic.The overall story is also weak. I mean, maybe there could be made a half-decent film out of the idea behind the movie.. mutated flesh eating parasites, it sounds pretty cool right?.. but in the context of the rest of the film this story only adds to the train-wreck that is called \"The Bay\"A part of me died while watching this film, I will never get it back, I\\'m scarred and I seriously want to kick the creator of this movie in the nuts.. or even better..

Mixed (very little) fact with fiction- and the fiction part just destroys any fact credibility.how does the reporter manage to survive despite getting the infected blood all over her, drinking from the fair grounds water bubbler and splashing water from the piers fountain all over her face? total BS- she doesn\\'t get the parasite but the doctor treating people does? that\\'s just one of a dozen silly illogical holes in this movie.coulld\\'ve been a great horror flick if the director spent a bit more time on the details and story line.', \"Turned it off after 20 minutes.

It basically sums up the romance genre in one predictably written cliched 80-minute film.  A young woman with low self-esteem moves in with her boyfriend.  She never really does anything that makes us believe she\\'s a perfect match for the man in her life.  Maybe she\\'s depressed or maybe she just has a negative outlook on life.  Who really knows.  It never says which one.  She cares WAY too much about herself as well, like the world should revolve around her \"problems\".She just... does nothing really.  Okay, she hangs out with friends and appears in all the places where guys can hit on her despite how embarrassing the men look when things suddenly go wrong (such as the one musician who jumps off stage and proposes marriage to her resulting in her running out of the concert as quickly as possible due to overwhelming shock and embarrassment).  Somehow even *this* scene blows due to lacking excitement.The tone is way too serious to be a comedy- that\\'s a MAJOR misleading part of the movie description.  Nothing\\'s even remotely funny ever.  The movie never even makes an effort to be hilarious.  All the characters are lifeless and dull with no personality whatsoever and the writing wouldn\\'t make the grade in any other context, let alone a film.  Save the Date reminds me of a time when a film as poorly written as this wouldn\\'t have stood a chance of seeing the light of day in theaters or DVD.  It\\'s amazing amazon doesn\\'t create a 0-star rating feature because Save the Date would easily be placed in the dark hole of 0-star ratings.

Both films scoring a well deserved 99% -98% on rottentomates.Enter \"I didn\\'t come here to die\" this film is more than unworthy in every respect to even stand in the shadows of these motion pictures, let alone be compared to them.Never theatrically released. First time director and writer of the film Bradley Scott Sullivan does a miserable job trying to weave a plot and a compelling story line by stealing specific shots of other, much better and well concieved horror movies - one example being the long shot of the van driving towards the woods - is right out of Chainsaw.Hollow performances by unknowns abound and dreary, sullen predictable dialogue - these are characters we could care less about and perhaps this is the movies most fatal flaw. Because not only is it important that we care about the characters we have to want to root for them - this clunker establishes neither.What those looking to cash in on the genre tend to do over and over is dismiss the intelligence of the audience they\\'re playing to. We\\'re far more both knowledgeable about what makes for good horror and what is more have a keen eye for cliche\\'. The film might as well have been titled \"Accident Prone In Woods\" I think even gore and splatter fans will find this movie disappointing and anyone with a decent eye, certainly any Dick Smith or Tom Savini fan will find the effects laughable at best.This is the kind of film you can walk into at any point and know immediately what you\\'re seeing and where it\\'s headed.

I cant believe they are making a sequel to the horrible first movie.', 'Everyone knew \"Liz and Dick\" was going to be a disaster as soon as it was announced. Two reasons why:1. It was being made by the Lifetime Network, with a TV-movie budget.2. It starred Lindsay Lohan.The pessimism was not unwarranted -- this movie is so bad that I\\'m surprised Richard Burton hasn\\'t risen from the dead just to throw liquor bottles at the people responsible. I actually hoped that it would be bad in a hilarious, campy way, but instead it\\'s just hideously awkward, cheesy and cheap. As Lohan croaks at one point, \"I\\'M SO BORED!\"The story is narrated by Elizabeth Taylor (Lohan) and Richard Burton (Grant Bowler) from the afterlife. Apparently the heavenly host really want to hear the inside scoop on their relationship. It started during the shooting of \"Cleopatra,\" when Shakespearean actor Burton was unexpectedly cast opposite the scandal-generating superstar Elizabeth Taylor.Well, despite a rocky start, they began a torrid affair. Their romance destroyed both their marriages (her fourth, his first) and caused an even bigger scandal than her previous homewrecking affair. Over the next twelve years, they lived in a whirl of fights, lovemaking, tragedy, alcoholism and gems -- only to divorce, marry and divorce all over again.The story of Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton really needs a HBO miniseries, because it\\'s impossible to cram twenty-plus years of high drama into a 90-minute Lifetime movie. And the rushed pace is only one of the movie\\'s problems -- cheap-looking costumes, awful greenscreen, and a choppy disjointed narrative.And yes, the writing is eye-rollingly bad (\"You do know I\\'m shagging him senseless, don\\'t you?\"), but not in a funny way. I hoped this would be an over-the-top, campy funny mess, but it was simply dull and fragmented.But the death knell for this movie is Lohan. I have literally seen cats who give better performances than her. Her performance in this movie is more Tommy Wiseau than Elizabeth Taylor -- a doughy, puffy-faced, larygngitic mess that croaks her way through unconvincing fights and crying jags, unable to even convey BOREDOM.And yes, she is even WORSE when she tries to convey some emotional depth (\"I am your ocean, but he was your anchor\"). For example, Taylor\\'s \"suicide\" -- complete with prancing, posing and Bella-Swan-style \"despairisms\" -- is one of the worst scenes I have seen on television. EVER.It makes me feel sorry for Grant Bowler, who actually seems to be trying REALLY REALLY HARD despite Lohan and a dreadful script dragging him down. Despite the movie\\'s awfulness, he does convey some of the tormented, hard-drinking poet, when he isn\\'t being saddled with dreadful dialogue. And David Hunt gives one of the few good performances as Burton\\'s tragic brother Ifor.I hoped that \"Liz and Dick\" would be a movie that was hilariously, mockably bad... but no, it\\'s just tedious and horribly written, with the worst-cast Elizabeth Taylor EVER.', \"Well, the cover of the DVD with such words as Scandal, Child Star, Love Affair, Paparazzi etc, etc.. You'd think the movie would be entertaining, interesting, with a sense of taboo that just makes you want to watch it en grossly just much like the real love Story between Elizabeth Taylor and Richard Burton was. But No, as a viewer I don't get that. I don't get the sense of passionate, scandalous and bizarre love affair. The Only thing I got from watching this Movie is a boring, bland and amateur re-telling of a supposedly legendary love story of two film stars.What else can I say? Lifeless acting from most of the cast. Especially, Lindsay Lohan. Who ever thought she would do a good job at playing Elizabeth Taylor must've had a whimsical sense of humor indeed. Not denying that she's a bad actress watch her act in Mean Girls, The Parent Trap I've gotta give her some credit for acting in these two movies but in this one. Uh-Uh she just did it all wrong! I didn't buy her as Elizabeth Taylor, I didn't buy the fact that she was madly in love to the point of damaging her career. She Just seemed off on screen. Not to mention the slim to none resemblance between her and the real Elizabeth, you'd think she'll put more effort into acting her role to compensate for that fact but no. I was pretty disappointed, the only thing she seemed to do was memorize lines and repeat them on screen with just a tad bit of emotions coming across. Even in her purposed outbursts she just seemed like a walking corpse that the writers weren't even interested in to begin with so they gave her horrendous lines and a very one dimensional character to portray.The Other actors aren't that great either but since they're not the main once they can get away with their zombie walks and poor acting skills. The One Playing Burton was acceptable but that's only because he was surrounded with such lame actors so he stood out as you can say. He tried his best for his defense too bad there was little he could do since the writing itself wasn't that helpful.The Movie itself was tasteless. Most of the time the viewers are told that this and that is happening. For Example, that Richard is cheating on his wife with another married woman which is Elizabeth and are deemed sinful in the eyes of the public but it just seems to come so easy for them afterwards. It's like no one really cares whether they were having an affair or not in such times when things like these were rare. The whole sense of impending danger, the whole sense of scandal is lost in this film.Watching it is like reading an article on the internet about Elizabeth and Richards relationship. That's all I can say. You might as well just read a 5 minute article instead of wasting your time watching this movie cause that's all you're gonna get in the end. The audience don't get to connect with the characters, we don't even get to meet them. We just see Lindsay Lohan presumably yelling, screaming, throwing fits of anger, crying, laughing, smoking, complaining, talking, swimming, kissing and whatever else she's doing on the film. And then the actors are just there. I could care less whatever happens to the characters at the end I don't even want to know. Even if the director decided to twist the story a little bit and have Elizabeth and Richard Commit suicide like Romeo and Juliet instead of divorcing I still wouldn't care.I Guess, I should give credit for the writers and producers for taking such a passionate love affair and making it such a boring, tedious and whiny one.And Lindsay Lohan please next time don't accept a role if you're not gonna act it properly. I'm sure the director didn't intend for you to be a wallflower with nice clothes and make up. You Actually have to act out your role you know.I don't know, if you wanna waste your time then watch this movie other than that skip it completely. I Know I'm sounding a tad too harsh but it's my honest opinion.\", 'I am truly amazed that I sat through this entire movie. However, you need to realize that I went into it knowing that it would be a train wreck, but it was far worse than I expected. \"Liz and Dick\" is a bloody massacre. For the record, I am actually a member of Team LiLo. As a child star, she showed great potential as a solid B-actress (remember \"The Parent Trap,\" Freaky Friday,\" and of course the iconic \"Mean Girls?\"). Then Lindsay Lohan grew up, went to rehab 50 times, got arrested 105 times, and unfortunately she hasn\\'t shown a whole lot of promise since then. I actually feel bad for her because she was so horribly miscast in this role. Lifetime obviously was desperate for viewers, and they cast LiLo as Elizabeth Taylor because they knew people like me would watch. And I did. And LiLo totally bombed.In fairness, the entire movie is an epic disaster (the only saving graces are the costumes, so props to the wardrobe mistress). First, let\\'s talk about Lindsay. Ignore the fact that my cat looks more like Liz Taylor than LiLo does (as I recall, Liz\\'s entire body wasn\\'t covered in freckles). Unfortunately, LiLo put absolutely zero effort into preparing for this role. What you see for two hours is LiLo wearing a bunch of dark wigs, speaking in her regular LiLo voice. There was no attempt to master Liz\\'s signature dialect, or the way she carried herself, or absolutely anything at all. Heck, she didn\\'t even try to ACT most of the time. Everything was completely half-assed. Even when she was playing Angry Drunk Elizabeth and smashing bottles against the wall, her throws were just PITIFUL. It was insulting. The dude playing Richard Burton is only slightly better because he actually tries to act, but just happens to be a really bad actor (decked out in an even worse hairpiece). The sets are awful. The script is languid. And parts of the movie make no sense whatsoever. (Like, they constantly poke fun at Liz for being chubby, but I read that LiLo is so vain that she refused to wear any kind of fat suit for the film, so Richard is poking fun at fat Liz who is wearing skintight leather pants and can\\'t weigh more than 105 pounds. Rewrite, anyone?)Everything. Is. SO. AWFUL. If you go into the film expecting to be entertained by watching really bad Lifetime television, like I was, you may end up pleasantly surprised in that \"Liz and Dick\" is ten times worse than anything you could have possible imagined it to be. My husband likened it to watching a high school theatre production, but I think that analogy is insulting to high school actors everywhere. Bottom line: Dame Elizabeth is rolling in her grave right now. I am glad she didn\\'t live to witness this monstrosity.', \"This is a cheap bad film with bad acting about a Hollywood icon.  Save your 99 cents. You'd be better off watching an episode of the-its so bad its hard to watch- 'Honey Boo-boo'\", 'Well, let\\'s give it points for trying, but A Dark Truth, a new Canadian produced echo-thriller unfortunately can\\'t get it\\'s act together. It\\'s self important and semi-pretenses, but it can\\'t be said that it doesn\\'t means well. Few movies address the issue of water rights in South America, and dare I say, even fewer action movies do. So, trying must account for something, but the sad truth is that A Dark Truth is a bust that never manages to succeed in it`s intent, but it\\'s intentions are noble enoughThe nearly always reliable Andy Garcia, recently and bewildering returning to leading man status, stars as Jack Begoison, a former CIA operative turned talk radio host. He lives in Canada, which might explain why his radio show isn\\'t a bunch of crazy rants about the supervise political message of Dr. Seus\\' the Lorax or that the Dark Knight Rises is an attack on a prominent Republican candidate. Although, one caller does ask about aliens in the white house. All of this has next to nothing to do with the movie, so let\\'s get back to that.From writer/director Damien Lee, who has more than twenty films to his directing  credit, movies such as Abraxas, Guardian of the Universe (starring Jesse Ventura) and Terminal Rush (with \"Rowdy\" Roddy Piper), among other movies you haven\\'t seen and other titles you`ll scoff at,. Lee seems to be prolific in the video/DVD world, I hesitate to say efficient, but I don\\'t think I have ever seen a movie he has made before. However, I feel safe in assuming this movie inadequacies are due to his rather dubious skills.A Dark Truth comes across looking very bad. It\\'s not well made, rather dull in it\\'s cinematography and editing. It\\'s writing is more an assembling of clich&eacute;s than an actually story, and some of the performances are rather lifeless. It\\'s the kind of theatrical film that only the first week of January can deliver.It can only be surmised that actors, a talented lot like Garcia, Eva Longoria, Forest Whitaker, Deborah Kara Unger, Kim Coates and Steven Bauer came on board this film because they believed in it\\'s message. Which is more understandable than wanting to say I just made a movie for the director ofAbraxas. Unfortunately, the message is lost in this muddled mess and all that\\'s left is a sad looking and less than entertaining jungle adventure. Whitaker seems asleep most of the time and Coates for the first time makes for a dull villain, it\\'s a shame when Bauer gives the best performance.About the half way point, A Dark Truth, abandons it\\'s original serious minded intent and becomes a rather indolent and generic action flick. The action scenes are badly filmed, too boat. Then it precedes to go on for too long fast tracking itself into a preachy On Deadly Ground style bummer. A Dark Truth may long to be a message film, but it ends up being the kind of movie that Tom Berenger used to make. I think few will see it, and even fewer will take anything useful from it.see my reviews at moviezonemagazine.com', \"Why are things like this on tv?We don't have enough senseless violence in this country? Enough people who get off on others' misery?\", 'We go to London for this latest creature feature based flick, where the contents of a secret military plane are scattered about the city. Despite the city being locked down some people totally oblivious to this fact enter a storage facility and become trapped (come on you were expecting a movie called \"Storage 24\" to NOT take place in a storage building?). At first things don\\'t seem all bad but soon it becomes clear that there is something inside with them and it\\'s on the prowl, that\\'s really about it folks.The early part with the plane crashing and the aftermath that occured was actually pretty well done. Sadly after the decent opening portions it boils down to a run and hide flick, the people inside try to avoid this creature, which for the budget doesn\\'t look horrible in short shots but the longer ones of it do show how goofy it looks. There\\'s a lot and I mean a lot of \"Don\\'t go in there\" or \"Don\\'t separate\" moments with all involved, but of course for the sake of the movie they all do stupid things that lead to their demise.There\\'s not a lot of scary parts, even the ones that involve the monster, in fact creepiest part was when one of the actors stumbles into a storage unit holding a bunch of creepy looking mannequins . I suppose the dark storage building was supposed to lend some good atmosphere to this typical plot, but there\\'s a lot of uneeded drama and bickering between some of the key characters that bogs portions of the film down.Others have compared how bad \"Storage 24\" is with \"Skyline\", which I can understand but to me \"Skyline\" was much more irritating. \"Storage 24\" is a pretty basic and badly acted monster movie but nothing more, \"Skyline\" seemed like it was aiming for something more and even a possible sequel from how it ended. * out of 4 stars.', \"I felt like the producers were attempting to remake ALIENS without the big budget or a scary enough creature.  My dogs fell asleep on this one.  They'll usually watch just about anything.  Not tonight! BOOORRRIIIINNNNGGGGG!\", \"The only thing I can say positive about Storage 24 is that the alien monster is great. It's an old fashion rubber monster man-in-a-suit kind of thing. But in this modern age, such a cheesy effect is bound to turn more people off than to win them over. And this is without a single doubt the best part of this agonizingly bad, cheaply made grade B with a minus British made mix of sci-fi and horror. A barrage of misogyny and stupidity that follows is bound to please only least demanding of paying customers, which I hope there are few.It all starts off with the slight twinkle of promise as an unexplained alien monster is on the loose inside of a storage unit. Also on the loose is a hand full of employees and patrons who are inexplicably trapped inside the storage facility with our guest from another world.So far, so good, but that's all about to change. because in no time at all, Storage 24 becomes a terrible prime time soap with a slimy monster who seems to change size given the requirements of any given scene. Sometimes he's human size, others he seems to tower above them. And this is only the beginning of this movies faults.Storage 24 was written by actors Noel Clarke and Marc Small, along with Davie Fairbanks, it is surprising in it's lack of good roles for just about anybody. The characters are simple one dimensional, obnoxious and unlikable. All the female roles are self-center, treacheras bitches. The men, self-loathing cowards.The acting is just shy of dismal. Not one of the cast members manage to give any substance to their roles, a few of them look like they would rather be home watching telly, which you can`t blame them. Leading lady Antonio Campbell-Hughes is a new kind of low for any actor who is not a professional athlete or musician making there way intro film.Given this material, one could imagine a very funny movie from Simon Pegg, Nick Frost and Edgar Wright, but alas, it is not meant  to be. Storage 24 is ungodly stupid, uninspired and worst painfully dull. Little more than a sub par retread of many other similar movies, some better, few not. The one that Storage 24 most resembles is that great summer turkey the Watch, perhaps my least favorite movie of last year. Yes, the kind of movie we all want to see more of. Showing that it isn't just us yanks who are creatively bankrupt.There is an appalling lack of interest here and zero energy to sustain the long 87 minute running time. Director Johannes Roberts, behind the gladly unseen DTD flicks like Hellbender and Forest of the Damned, clearly has no eye for the camera. Shot in a single location, not only does that let you know it's cheap, it just looks it and feels it even more. Roberts has given us an amateur hour and a half here. You wont be able to believe such a movie is still released into American cinemas. Even going in with low expectations,  you will be astonished at how low they would have had to have been.In my original review for Movie Zone, I gave this stinker a half of a star, but amazon wont let me do that.

This show is another in the recent trend of tricking people into buying a program with the enticement that they are going to see a documentary about a subject that is new or at least out of the mainstream but are instead shown 44 minutes of an unqualified host getting on planes, driving in cars, hiking and camping out, sometimes talking to supposed indigenous people and lots of talking to other unqualified \"experts\" about how mainstream (translation: real experts) don\\'t agree with what they say in the script. It\\'s obvious that the host and his gaggle of fake experts don\\'t believe a word of the gibberish they spout. This program\\'s host is one of the poorest actors. None of the hosts of these fraudulent \"mystery-documentaries\" do a very good job of convincing you that they actually believe the nonsense they recite from the script. This program\\'s host is utterly unconvincing, obviously unqualified and unacceptably foul-mouthed. He obviously thinks he\\'s being edgy when he cusses which kills any likability.

Constantly trying to hook onto some form of kitsch or pop-culture to make itself relevant and consistently failing to do so.

It is just an excuse for people to cus for no reason and pretend there is a legitimate reason for it.', \"I have in the past really liked Timothy Olyphant (like in Deadwood), and I found earlier seasons of Justified kinda entertaining. Olyphant has the ability to play a straight-arrow hero in a unique and wonderful way. The trouble with Justified is that he has become less and less heroic. He doesn't stand for anything, anymore. He seems just like the low-lifes he pursues, except he's got a badge. Nothing important is at stake - just whether the addicts of Harlan County get their fix. I say leave them alone with their devices, Raylan. Oh, and do we have to put up with a whole new helping of overdone evangelical crap? We've already seen all this in the first season. False preaching can only divert us for so long. I wish they would transplant Raylan Givens to some city where some dastardly plot is afoot that actually matters to somebody.

I'm sorry but I have grown weary of writers and directors who think that they can paint themselves as artists by making an incoherent movie with characters no one cares about that flows free form from one scene to the next in an attempt to be different. You're not different you're just bad.The basic premise here is Charles Swan III (portrayed by Charlie Sheen copying his performances from TWO AND A HALF MEN and ANGER MANAGEMENT) stars as a man in love with a woman who leaves him when she discovers he has a drawer filled with Polaroid pictures of past conquests. Why he feels the need to keep these around in such an open area who knows. Distraught at her leaving he attempts to drive after her, wrecks his car and ends up in the hospital.From here the movie goes every which way it can. It moves backward and forward in time, it moves into the surreal world of Charles's mind, it bring in characters just made for cameos and it goes nowhere fast. Some reviews of this film have called it genius and others have called it one of the worst films ever made. I tend to fall in the latter group.I found it difficult just to get through a large portion of this film let alone from beginning to end. I'll be the first to admit I never got there. Something inside of me said that there were better things in this world I could be doing than watching this piece of manure posing as art. Movies like this do little but make me angry when I read about other films that have lingered on shelves for years that sounded good but never got made. Then I realize that someone gave the people behind this movie money to make it and I think why this and not that?The film was written/directed by Roman Coppola who co-wrote THE DARJEELING LIMITED and MOONRISE KINGDOM with director Wes Anderson. I've never been a huge fan of Anderson for many of the reasons this film didn't work, but at least I've been entertained by them in one way or another. This movie feels like it was made by a fanboy of Anderson's who wanted to show he could make just as quirky a film. Instead it falls flat on its face offering a boring film that makes no sense and is difficult to watch let alone enjoy.Don't let the cover fool you. Names like Charlie Sheen, Bill Murray, Patricia Arquette and Jason Schwartzman may be listed in the credits but I could only believe they did this movie as a favor to Coppola. They would have done him a bigger favor by telling him that yes indeed; the king wasn't wearing any clothes.\", \"Last season this show started out phenomenal.

The only good thing about the show is that they managed to cast Kevin Bacon in it and he is usually a guaranteed sign of quality. I take that back, there is something else that is good about the show; the premise of it. The first two episodes of \"The Following\" are promising in the sheer sense that the show COULD have great promise. A serial killer. A back story. A detective with a history and a relationship with the serial killer\\'s wife. A serial killer who can commit crimes from prison due to a cult following of psychos. All of these great ideas are squandered.The reasons why these ideas are squandered is, in my opinion, for one simple reason: \"The Following\" is trying to be \"24\". In an effort to be relentless, non-stop, intense action and thrills, \"The Following\" throws an event at you every five minutes. Therefore, instead of being intelligently fleshed out, it is hastily fleshed out. Every five minutes the show opens itself up for continuous ridicule for stupid teenage criminals, stupid FBI agents who should have known better, criminals who aren\\'t tracked or followed, or just plain illogical assumption story archs. Instead of the creators doing some research and giving us a reason to think that Joe Carroll (the serial killer) is brilliant, we are left to just assume so.Instead of being intelligently thought out, the show relies upon gimmicks; murderers who don\\'t murder but talk, murderers who have no reason to leave someone alive but do because that person isn\\'t supposed to die yet, victims explaining why the murderer didn\\'t kill them, \"He said he didn\\'t kill me because a live hostage would slow you down more than a dead one.\"  Oh, he did huh? Well that was nice of him.... thanks for the info. A detective held by three teenage murderers whittling through his ropes with a hidden knife and they don\\'t see it despite all of them standing ten feet away. Then you have a serial killer who just calls the detective pretty much every episode and has a nice chat and tells him how screwed he is.Mainly though, the \"24\"ish format to the show asks the creators to explain escapes and FBI blunders every five minutes and after about 10 of those, or two episodes, the gimmick is over. Then when it continues, the show becomes eye-roll boring and has absolutely zero tension. The tension has no intelligence to it. There is zero tact to the show. Where a show like \"CSI\" would take the time to explain some of the reasoning or how things happened or worked, \"The Following\" doesn\\'t have time for that, and when it does, the explanation is ridiculous.Nobody should be giving this show 5-stars in my opinion. NOBODY. This is not a great show. Nowhere close. Is it a terrible show, like my 1-star suggests? I think so. Maybe that is too harsh. Yet when I see a show that has so much promise and lucky people are making MILLIONS OF DOLLARS to entertain us and they give us something that absolutely ANYBODY with basic writing skills could write, you can\\'t be too harsh. When the writers and directors have zero TACT or make no attempt to be intelligent in their tact, but just give you every horror/thriller cliche in the book and expect you to drool and return every week.

But hey, we can\\'t do anything about that, we\\'re just providing you with the convenience of not having to have an antenna too.\" They didn\\'t mention that MOST people were getting cable to fix the problem of having to risk their lives installing antennas only to get notoriously unreliable lousy reception. So, like frogs thrown into a pot of cold water that is slowly heated up will fool them into staying in the pot, people just dealt with the gradually increasing temperature of the water i.e. ads, ads and more ads that were promised not to be there. Then, simulcast sports events came and the cable company said, \"We can\\'t do anything about it, the networks are forcing us to include the ads. Besides, what do you expect us to do when they cut to ads?\" Then they said, \"Inflation! Everyone has to raise prices. You can either pay higher subscription fees or put up with ads on heretofore commercial-free stations.\" And the frog stew was ready to be served.So go ahead and submit to be boiled alive. The rest of us are jumping out of the pot. Rivet, rivet.', \"Please stop the commercials or we will stop buying these. Clearly someone has lost sight of why we buy these videos. If we wanted commercials we would watch regular tv. We pay a premium per episode for a reason. If you take away that reason we stop buying videos.

The *fifth* season?! How many silly seasons can there possibly be? And all the true believer reviewers again! \"Lots of cool facts\". Geezus. Good people, there are arguably *no* true facts in this series *at all*.True to form, I\\'ve only watched one episode, \"The Von Daniken Legacy\". I admit that I hate Erich von D&auml;niken. His ideas or \"question marks\" about aliens visiting Earth in ancient times (in pyramid-like UFOs, to boot) must be *the* worst superstition ever spawned. Homeopathy and reductionist materialism, come back, all is forgiven! D&auml;niken\\'s \"theories\" are so remarkably ridiculous in a kind of inimitable folksy style, with the main protagonist playing the role of fat German bar-owner spewing \"common sense\", that they almost make me weep! The fact that I used to believe in ancient aliens myself only ads insult to the injury. OK, I was only eleven at the time, but hell, I\\'m a perfectionist.And yes, I need to chill and have a candy bar, I know...OK, I\\'m back. Has \"Ancient Aliens\" become any better during my coffee break? Well...no. So here goes!I\\'m not necessarily opposed to rejected knowledge claims (avid readers of my reviews, all two of them, may have noticed a certain soft spot for Bigfoot and...ahem...John Michael Greer), but D&auml;niken\\'s speculations really are annoying and extremely unsophisticated. D&auml;niken, a romantic adventurer of the classical kind, has no formal training in archaeology, anthropology or comparative mythology I\\'m aware of. Yet, he goes around the world, see mysterious stone structures, declare them \"impossible\" and...voil&aacute;, this proves that aliens built them! The magnificent stone structures at Puma Punku in Bolivia are declared \"impossible\", when a more reasonable hypothesis is that they *aren\\'t* impossible at all - I mean, they are there, aren\\'t they, and they are made out of sandstone, not moon rock. That the local Natives can\\'t build them, and point to the sky as explanation for who did, leads D&auml;niken to conclude that...well, aliens did it. It\\'s all so breathtakingly simple.Another example is Lord Pakal at Palenque in Mexico, debunked at least 10,000+ times, but still going strong. If looked at horizontally and with some creative imagination, the lid of Pakal\\'s tomb looks like a guy manning a space rocket. If looked at vertically, using scholarly knowledge of Mayan mythology and iconography, the magnificent artwork shows Pakal being symbolically sacrificed. But no, D&auml;niken\\'s folksy immediate impression simply must be true, or else no ratings for History Channel...Indeed, it\\'s precisely the populist style, pitting independent researcher against the scientific establishment, which explains part of D&auml;niken\\'s appeal. D&auml;niken is our \"audience substitute\". While everything you read in peer-reviewed journals isn\\'t necessarily true, there *is* a reason why archaeologists need formal training, not just the ability to run around inside megalithic monuments gasping at the sheer \"impossibility\" of it all. There is another salient feature of the ancient astronaut milieu, too, one D&auml;niken is at pains to explicitly deny in this documentary. D&auml;niken says he hasn\\'t formed a new religion. In a purely formal sense, he is right. He is *attacking* religion by a modern form of euhemerism, in which the gods are explained away in \"naturalist\" fashion as space travellers in nuts-and-bolts craft. What D&auml;niken doesn\\'t want to see, but what surely almost everyone else spotted long ago, is that the belief in ancient astronauts is *in effect* a new kind of religion. At the very least, D&auml;niken is offering the masses a potent substitute for religion. The large amount of spiritual types who have climbed onboard the fiery chariot surely shows what we are dealing with. As for D&auml;niken himself, he even claims that the aliens created us and will return one day! Thus, he is specifically tailoring his speculations to an audience used to the *Christian* religion. I don\\'t think Taoists, Shintoists or the Dogon in Mali eagerly awaits \"the return of the gods\"...Claude Vorhillon and his Ralians are the most obvious example of how \"ancient aliens\" can be turned into a religion (a religion which claims to be materialist, in fact). In their case, the quasi-Biblical traits are very obvious. Zecheriah Sitchin is another example of a person forming what is really a new religious movement around ideas presumably inspired by D&auml;niken\\'s. And D&auml;niken himself? Isn\\'t he really the exoteric attractor of the new creed, its Aaron so to speak? If you take the bait, I\\'m sure more \"esoteric\" people are waiting in the wings. I\\'ve heard that the Ancient Astronaut Society, which started as a D&auml;nikenite fan club, ended up as a New Age group. Thus, paradoxically the appeal of D&auml;niken\\'s message could be seen as a combination of both populist anti-science and elitist \"hidden knowledge\", both modern irreligion and post-modern religion. An interesting object for a comparative religion study, I\\'m sure! These people don\\'t understand that *they* are the ones that should be placed under the sociological and psychological microscope...The religious/Meaning aspect is surely the reason why so many people are oblivious to the (easily spotted) contradictions in D&auml;niken\\'s books. How can aliens (that\\'s *aliens*, for heaven\\'s sake!) breed true with humans? If they can, why has no alien DNA been found in our gene pool? (Albert Einstein doesn\\'t count.) Why would aliens need to build stone structures at Puma Punku, if they have super-advanced technology light years ahead of us? Why aren\\'t there any *real* traces of a high technological civilization in India, if the Vedic peoples interacted with aliens? D&auml;niken\\'s supporters point to \"mysteriously\" charred stone walls as evidence for ancient A-bombs, making you wonder why the bombs didn\\'t obliterate the whole town, rather than just charring its walls...Seriously, should I continue?Are there real, unsolved mysteries in the universe? Oh, definitely. You already know which ones: where do we come from, why are we here, where are we going... And why *this* fun house of a planet? I\\'m willing to contemplate the erroneousness of materialism, the existence of Spirit, even one or two paranormal phenomena (although hopefully not on my favourite Swiss hotel). But literal, flesh-and-blood (or green jelly) aliens scaring the living daylights out of Moses, breeding true with female ape-men, and erecting stone structures of a suspiciously-looking human provenance all around the globe just for their higher amusement (and ours?)...naaaah. It\\'s bad archaeology, bad anthropology, bad comparative religion, and - when push comes to shove - probably even bad spirituality.Erich von D&auml;niken and his fiery chariots is a legacy I would rather loose. One star.', 'I can\\'t believe they charged me $2 for this 2 minute \"free sneak peek #2\" ?! Any \"sneak peak\" should be free and this series is already running out of interesting topics.', 'As with all episodes in this increasingly silly series, a quick internet search reveals that there is no credibility to the claims of \"crystal skull enthusiasts\". The peddlers of this series do not give their audience much credit. They think we will not check them out. They are wrong.I do check them out and their production does not check out.The only reason to watch this episode is to see how biased and inaccurate these \"Ancient Aliens\" are. When you are done watching this episode you will be left with the \"Ancient Alien Enthusiasts\" conclusions that mystical crystal skulls of ancient origin have been found and are sizzling and popping with paranormal powers and that the mother of them all is the \"Skull of Doom\".Here are the true facts that were easily available and well known to all of the writers, producers and commentators of this program are NEVER presented in this program. These facts were unearthed by a legitimate set of producers, writers and commentators at National Geographic who aired a well-documented legitimate documentary two years before this illegitimate and completely undocumented nonsense was put together by the \"Ancient Alien Enthusiasts\".The National Geographic documentary is called \"The Truth Behind: The Crystal Skulls\" and it completely debunks the nonsense of crystal skulls. Crystal skulls have been conclusively proven not to be ancient. The first crystal skull every produced was manufactured in the latter half of the 19th century. Crystal skulls are not something ancient people had anything to do with. They are irrefutably not of any paranormal origin and they certainly have nothing to do with extraterrestrial beings which of course don\\'t exist except in the imaginations of people with hairdo challenges.Crystal skulls were never created by ancient people for any reason at any time in any part of the world.The purported origin of the most famous crystal skull peddled as the \"Skull of Doom\" and officially known as the Mitchell-Hedges Skull is a 100% pure fabricated hoax. But the little old lady peddling the hoax seemed utterly believable. Even some of the best legitimate scientists were unable to summarily dismiss the little old lady\\'s story.The skull was the icon of Arthur C. Clarke\\'s Mysterious [X] series and is shown on the opening screen of each episode. If the little old lady piqued the interest of the totally legitimate scientist Arthur C. Clarke (who did not know the facts of it\\'s fraudulent origins and only presented what was known at the time) there is reason to investigate the story in a serious way.It was difficult to do hard probing when the hoaxer was a very believable cute little old lady named Anna Mitchell-Hedges who seemed so instantly reliable that on first meeting her you\\'d trust her to babysit your kids without any further references.But she was an absolute fraud! Whether deluded or wickedly deceptive, and in possible collusion with her father, she fabricated a fantastically believable story of how she acquired the crystal skull by seeing a glimmer in the depth of some Mayan ruins in Belize on her 17th birthday (a detail she always included in telling the story which I thought a bit unusual; you\\'d expect to find her leaving out the birthday detail once in awhile but she never failed to mention it).We now know she never visited the site of the excavation in which she claims to have found the skull. Another clue that something was amiss is that she always mispronounces excavation as \"escavation\"in interviews. This always made me wonder about her and her father\\'s actual level of training which we now know was nonexistent. Her father was nothing more than an exotic traveler who had no professional training in any field even remotely related to archaeology.The truth is her father bought the skull at auction and the records of the sale exist to confirm it. The skull was made by a European sculptor who used a European person\\'s skull as the model. Anna Mitchell-Hedges was either delusional or deceptive as was her father. Although her father seems to have held back on perpetuating the hoax, he did include a false reference to the skull as being Mayan in his first autobiography but removes the reference in subsequent editions. And he did not peddle the lie about the skull being an ancient Mayan artifact found in Belize unlike his cunning/delusional daughter did her whole life.My personal opinion based on Anna Mitchell-Hedges obsession with stating that she found the crystal skull on her birthday is that her father gave the skull to her as a birthday present. And he did not just give it to her but planted it in some genuine ruins that Anna Mitchell-Hedges had to actually dig through and so she got to feel the thrill of finding an ancient artifact which she also mentions each and every time she tells the story.The \"ruins\" were known by Anna Mitchell-Hedges not to be in Belize and the skull was known not to be a genuine ancient origin. But Anna Mitchell-Hedges wanted the story to be true and so she embellished it and elaborated a bit more each time she told it. Every other so-called mystic crystal skull has an equally faulty story behind its origin and paranormal properties.None of the above facts are presented in this episode and remember: all of the above facts were readily and easily available to anyone with an internet connection at the time they produced this utterly valueless episode of \"Ancient Alien Whatever\".What a waste of time this lowest quality program has become.', 'I detest streaming videos. Where is the DVD set for the 2013 Dallas season 2? I want the hard copy. Not some virtual version controlled by a 3rd Party. Consumers need to stand their ground to ensure we continue to have the option of DVD\\'s for our movies & TV episode seasons.Fortunately, I did tape every episode on VHS as a precaution just in case they pulled a dirty trick like this. Season one was immediately available on DVD at the end of the broadcast season. But season 2 is nowhere to be seen. No evidence they plan to offer DVD\\'s at all for season 2.I don\\'t use DVR\\'s because those are worse. As an example, the network was able to have the cable & sat providers delete a controversial episode of Jesse Ventura\\'s conspiracy theory from every DVR it had been recorded on. These deletions surgically occurred across multiple providers who claimed it was a software upgrade glitch which deleted this one particular episode on the same week, about 2 months after it was aired, from the DVR\\'s of every customer which had recorded via DVR.  Fortunately, mine was on VHS where they couldn\\'t get to it. There were hundreds of viewers complaining in the online forums how that episode was deleted on all of their DVR\\'s despite using different providers. You can probably still find these complaints online.This is just one example of the drawbacks of soft copies like streaming video, DVR & instant episodes. Even if the DVR was disconnected, a command can be inserted to delete an episode the next time the unit is accessed.  At any future point, these can be remotely deleted with simple commands. Many years ago, I was on the original design team for these DVR & interactive set top boxes for the cable & sat companies. The capabilities for these devices are far more invasive than anyone can imagine. Why do you think they give away these DVR boxes. I specifically purchased plain set top boxes from direct TV which do not have DVR\\'s. Also, by owning the equipment, they cannot arbitrarily upgrade or change anything.This info will likely mean nothing to you until it is too late; after one of your recorded episodes has been deleted without warning & blamed on some glitch. All it takes is the fear of a lawsuit for a network to order the discreet elimination of some episode without warning.Also, avoid Ultraviolet DVD\\'s which install spyware on your computer & can delete other movies & videos on your computer which is determined not to meet certain standards. You should be able to find comments on this website which pertain to the drawbacks of Ultraviolet.Fighting to insist on DVD versions for movies & TV just may be the last vestige of control remaining between the public & absolute control of providers.

A massive carnival -- fireworks, puppets, costumes, crowded frivolity -- billows around him as he stops and asks, over and over, where he can get a boat. Everyone points him down the street a ways. He wanders in that direction for a bit before stopping to ask yet another person. Over and over. Finally he finds a man in a bar who agrees to rent him his personal boat that he uses for work. The man goes back to his motel room (and pregnant wife) pleased. The next day, he finds the man at the dock, and without making any kind of real arrangements -- no paperwork, no discussion about where he's going, no ID, just a wad of cash handed over -- the couple takes the boat and sails off into some seriously bombastic opening credits, the kind that think volume is a good substitute for craft.I'm not sure what the point of this very drawn-out, very misleading intro was meant to be, but it neatly summarizes a lot of what's wrong with this film. It has a broken-ankle pacing, too much information is left out and what isn't is both repetitive and misleading, and never is there a real sense of who these people are, what they want to do, and what's going on around them. It gets worse when they land on an island that appears to be populated only by children of sinister intent.I'll grant you, the bones of the story aren't too shabby. In abler hands -- with stronger dialogue, more believable characters, and kids that can actually act -- the film could've been quite a thrill. It's just that the movie has nothing more going for it than its central concept, which is really just a kernel of what it should be. None of the concepts or ideas that surround it are explored. No real lessons are learned. Even when people are (ostensibly) running for their lives, it feels like nothing is at stake. Perhaps that's because the editing is so choppy, or the soundtrack is so inconsistent and in-your-face, or the characters are so featureless, or the attempts at gore and shock are mostly just intrusive and laughable.

I would say that this film was written by a disbarred lawyer, but even disbarred lawyers are familiar with the basics of ethics and morality. The writers of this film seem to have no understanding, nor familiarity with ethics.Perhaps the greatest reason that superheroes are a classical storytelling device is the fact that they offer the opportunity to draw clear delineations between what is right, and what is wrong. Superheroes often face moral dilemmas, but what makes them superheroes is the fact that they make the right choices, no matter how hard it is to do what\\'s right. Otherwise, they\\'re superVILLAINS. Superpowers, super abilities, and super tech do not make superheroes. CHOICES make superheroes.Now let\\'s examine the choices that this \"superhero\" family makes.Although the father recognizes that he needs to \"protect his family from a murderous mainframe\", when faced with the financial repercussions of possibly losing his house, he caves stating \"fine, just don\\'t blow up my house\".

Got it.Furthermore, the father loses any reluctance about the arrangement with the \"murderous mainframe\" once it becomes obvious to him that he can use the Grim Avenger tech to make his personal life better by using it for chores.After seriously scorching his neighbor\\'s house using a laser to trim hedges, rather than try to repair the damage, or make reparations, or even confess to it, he runs and hides like the deadbeats who hit someone\\'s parked car in the parking lot and leave without taking responsibility.The wife agrees to go to (in her own words) \"a dinner date\" at one of the most expensive restaurants in town alone with her gorgeous playboy coworker. All of the professional, married women that I know don\\'t eat meals with nor travel with male coworkers alone, but only in a group.When it becomes apparent to the father that \"The Flamingo\" is rampaging across the city in order to force a showdown, the father chooses to address largely invented family emergencies instead, at the cost to countless other families.To spy on his wife on her dinner date with Richard, the father implants a Grim Global Positioning Tracker in Richard, even though he\\'s at first horrified by the danger of implanting it in someone\\'s spinal cord (but, hey, it\\'s okay if you don\\'t like the guy, right?) because he\\'s \"protecting his family\". Evidently, trust for your spouse isn\\'t requisite in protecting your family. (And later he ironically berates the computer for invading his daughter\\'s privacy by checking Facebook.)The father, rather than allow Richard to drive away with his wife, destroys Richard\\'s Corvette.The son, upon acquiring one of Grim Avenger\\'s power gauntlets, and after destroying a neighbor\\'s treehouse, rather than make reparations, or a confession, cuts and runs (perhaps taking a cue from his father\\'s lack of moral compass).The son uses the power gauntlet to bully a bully (becoming the evil that he had resented and detested).The father constantly shirks his end of the bargain, doing everything that he can to avoid training and crime fighting.The father uses the \"Hypno Spray\" to brainwash the most popular boy at his daughter\\'s school in order to completely reform him and force him to be his daughter\\'s boyfriend, then congratulates himself with \"THAT\\'s how to parent!\"The father uses the x-ray goggles to cheat at the scratch-off lottery, by finding winning tickets.The son and daughter abandon her tasered, unconscious boyfriend on their porch, because they\\'re busy fighting over who gets the power gauntlet.The father uses the Grim Avenger super car just to get to his wife\\'s dinner in the city, then uses the Grim Avenger persona to save her presentation by offering the persona for marketing purposes. (Then berates his children for using the super car to cheat \"whenever things get hard\", but never realizes how hypocritical that is.)The father allows his children to use the super car to get to school, so that he can continue to do marketing as the Grim Avenger for his wife. (Then is surprised when they abuse it to skip school and become more popular.) This also potentially endangers his family by exposing his secret identity, but the show never addresses this. It also eventually leads to \"The Flamingo\" gaining control of the super car, but fortunately for the city all he cares about is revenge, otherwise the city would have been screwed, no thanks to our \"heroes\".The daughter uses the automated super car to cheat and pass her driver\\'s exam.The son speculates about selling Grim Avenger tech on eBay for money.The son uses tattling about his sister\\'s using the super car to pick up friends so that he can get out of trouble for skipping school.The father puts his children in danger by pursing criminals with them just to show them how important of a responsibility it is (even though it\\'s the first time that he\\'s bothered to do any crime fighting).In answering his last chance questions, the father makes it clear in his answers that his family comes first, no matter the cost to society and the city. The movie deems that to be a virtue. What happens to the superhero (or superspy) families that were willing to put their families on the line for others? That viewed the well-being of society as higher than their own well-being? Since when is selfishness a virtue? Disregard for others? Unwillingness to sacrifice?The family abandons a helpless, tied-up Richard in the same warehouse that had previously exploded and killed the prior Grim Avenger.The movie tries to have a huge moment at the end in the final fight where the father \"realizes\" a bunch of things like \"heroes don\\'t need masks\", but he doesn\\'t actually realize anything meaningful. He comes off as a groundlessly cocky jerk, not someone who has been on a revelatory journey. It\\'s trite, with all of the moral goodness of twinkies.The movie ends with the family continuing to try to find ways to pimp out the Grim Avenger persona for marketing money. (Then the father laughably asserts at the end of the film that \"This city needs us\" even though the opposite has been shown throughout the entire film.)So how\\'s \"The Flamingo\" the most morally upright? He goes out of his way to make sure that his actions don\\'t cause physical harm, almost to a laughable degree. On the other hand, the \"superhero\" family runs him over with a car, uses the \"Hypno Spray\" on him to brainwash him so that he can become their personal lawn care help rather than turning him in to authorities, and when the \"Hypno Spray\" wears off, they have a deadly robot ready to threaten him with physical harm if he doesn\\'t trim their hedges. Nice. I\\'m so glad that a family with such a high regard for human life, and no propensity for abusing power has been granted so much power. (Please note the sarcasm. Please?)Much of this would have been fine if there had been morals to any of these experiences where the family learned that what they had done was wrong, and that there are more important things in life than themselves. This isn\\'t the case at all. It\\'s the opposite. Everything works out despite them not learning any lessons, and merely reinforces that they can cavalierly do whatever they want at the expense of any others. Most of the immoral and unethical things that this family does end up having ZERO negative consequences for the family (although, the same cannot be said for the innocent public who is saddled with this supervillain family).The problem with this film concept is that the family is detestable. The computer is right: they don\\'t deserve access to the Grim Avenger\\'s tech. They abuse it, and constantly put others in danger as a result. Their most dominant trait is family selfishness (they aren\\'t necessarily selfish individually, but their family as a group acts selfishly towards the rest of the world). They act as if their family and the happiness of the family justify any other type of action, no matter the repercussions for the rest of the world. If this family has to choose between either doing the right thing OR being happy, this family inevitably chooses to be selfishly happy. This family is closer to a family of supervillains, then a family of superheroes. Like supervillains, they use their powers for family gain rather than for the betterment of society.This show is detestable for its lack of ethics, and tone deafness, and is likely unsalvageable. Relegate the whole concept to the trash heap, or be honest, and make a show glamorizing a supervillain family.', 'Did bot finish watching this it was a boring cartoon. Amazon made a mistake this one.  Should habe had real people and real breast.', 'I have always been intrigued by the Amityville killings and the hauntings (i.e. \"Horror\"). I have found the film itself to be one of the better made horror films in its genre due to its supposed true story. I even red the Jay Ansen book and found that just as scary. Even if in the back of my mind, my beliefs through the years have turned a little cynical with the validity of this tale, my child-brain still believes in a fascinated way. So I continue to explore some new information.This new entry into the world of the Amityville Drama is about Daniel Lutz, step-son of George and son Kathy Lutz. Throughout the film, Daniel emphasizes his hate towards George. He is filled with anger at almost every step and seems to never let go of this, despite his therapeutic efforts to either resolve the issue or at least get to the truth of it.This documentary does neither to explore the truth or his own personal anger, but rather carries the torch that George and Kathy had started out in 1979 about the hauntings of the house. His descriptions of the happenings in the house are virtually a verbatim of either the book or the movie. If anyone knows anything about Hollywood \"true stories\" they almost never follow the reality in favor of embellishment for the entertainment value, as well never follow the narrative of a book as some things are unfit for movie adaptations for purposes of translating. So what we are left with is an angry guy who decides to take his own cut of the Amityville Horror in the wake of his parents death.The documentary filmmaker, Lauren Dido (?), does not seem to uncover anything. Nor does she ask the right questions. But just incites Daniel half of the time. It is almost as if this is just another scam, in the same way George, Kathy and Jay put together the book and later the movie. This telling, however, is much less successful. I think for those who just need to find out what is in this documentary will want to watch it despite any review will have to decide for themselves about what is in this. Even though I fall into that category, I personally found it dull, boring and insulting.', 'Daniel Lutz is probably the most annoying person I have ever seen in a documentary. He comes off as obnoxious and immature.  To make matters worse it seemed like a vanity piece for him and because of that the rest of the movie felt and probably was a sham.  It was just a way for him to make a quick buck and get some attention.  The shots of him playing guitar were totally unnecessary and I really could not find one likeable thing about this man.  I have never seen a documentary where the main subject has not one redeeming quality.  Well, this was a first for me because by the end I still couldn&#8217;t see anything about Mr. Lutz that made me want to root for him.  In fact it was quite the opposite.  I hope this was his 15 minutes and we never have to hear or see from him again.It was very hard to sit through and I didn&#8217;t believe one word he said.  He actually reminded me of a prison inmate that would say anything to get parole.', \"Perhaps it's because I'm a Fire Fly and Star Trek junkie, but this series was not impressive to me at all.

Having said that the owner of the restaurant gets what he deserves if he trusted this guy in the first place.At least when Gordon Ramsey takes on a restaurant he gives them a professional remodel not a cheap job that will probably fall apart in less than a month.

Instead I got scenes from other Kubrick films, played against random voiceovers of people who sound like they were nerds sitting in their barcaloungers in their parents' basement talking about how much the movie meant to them.  A huge, HUGE letdown pile of nonsense.  Real disappointment.\", 'As the camera slowly moves in on Danny brushing his teeth, there, on the left side of the wall is a sticker of Dopey from Disney\\'s Snow White and the Seven Dwarves. Later, after Danny is revealed by Toby some of the incidents that will occur at the Overlook Hotel, it would appear that the sticker is no longer there. The \"theorist\", by way of narration, explains that Danny is \"no longer a dope\". Yup, this theory and more abound in ROOM 237, a supposedly insightful, highly subjective, examination of Stanley Kubrick\\'s The Shining.I was not really sure what to expect. Will I hear about symbolism? Hidden gestures by Kubrick to reveal the larger truth of the film? An explanation of the film itself and what some of the more mysterious moments meant? You will not be treated to any of these things that one might assume at face value. In fact, nothing that is \"revealed\" has anything to do with the movie. Apparently all of the theories relate to some outside dilemma that Kubrick (presumably) was grappling with and felt the need to embed these ideas in this film. Why that is the case no one answered.If anyone has seen the documentary Kubrick\\'s Odyssey, they will well learn that Kubrick faked the moon landing for Nasa using the same effects as in 2001, and that, for keeping this a secret, he revealed clues laid out throughout the movie in this film. In ROOM 237, the same author retells much of that theory in this film so it might be redundant.Other theories regard its a film about the Holocaust, the genocide of the American Indians, or the mythological Minotaur. Or you just need to watch the film forward and backward simultaneously. All of these theories might be interesting on their own with no regard to content or context. Together they are just a mash of ideas with no thread in place. One even wonders if The Shining is a basis for their conclusions or if its just their own fanatical ideas being projected onto a very psychological playing field.It becomes clear that these 5 people who admire Stanley Kubrick\\'s The Shining, know how to inspect the film and its intricate details, but do not seem to know how to watch a film. Or at least interpret properly the language of cinema. What they explain gives the view no insights into the film itself, nor of Stanley Kubrick. Beginning with the obvious, that Jack Nicholson\\'s character slowly goes mad from isolation might be a good place to start to draw the viewer in their thinking. Instead we are slapped with obscure objects in the background that is faintly paid attention to by most casual viewers.Because of this, I cant help but feel that all these interpretations are complete non-sense and have no place in a serious discussion of the film. The film is almost a joke and I wonder if the director is exploiting these people who seriously believe in their theories? It would be sad that Kubrick\\'s film was used to make such a joke by the director. If he believes anything these theorists propose, then the director needs to revisit a book on symbology. I can\\'t recommend this film, but I suspect ardent Kubrick fans will want to see it and understandably so. If that is the case, then it is not a terrible viewing.

You don\\'t end up having stupid things like a character singing a slow, \"moving\" cover of Girls Just Want to Have Fun (ask the Glee fans about that), or... well anything that happened in Viva Laughlin, because the songs are written to what the characters are thinking, so you have the inner monologue moments that come with having a musical; the characters emotions truly come out in the songs.

Even Bebe Neuwerth, the original Morticia Addams on Broadway, among many others, couldn\\'t save the song she was given, which gleefully finds a whole bunch of things to rhyme with *Word I Cannot Say in Amazon Reviews*, while failing on a level as a song, and really not doing a good job of telling us about the character. It\\'s a shame she\\'s not used more, as she\\'s channeling Ariana Huffington by way of Portia DeRossi\\'s character in Better Off Ted (look at that costume), but leaning in to neither of them. The other four leads are some variation on a stock comic character, the Rachel Berry, the Stoned, Weird, Net-Friendly Asian, The Awkward Dork, and The Organized, Righteous Black Man. They each get a song (save the latter), each song is uniquely bad in it\\'s own way. Mercifully, they\\'re all much shorter.The plot points are all very familiar, the characters are all very familiar, and the show does nothing with them because it takes time to tell in a few minutes what it could tell in 30 seconds, and the normal saving grace of the musical, catchy, emotion-rending songs, are not there. It\\'s a fascinating failure, and it\\'s definitely Amazon swinging for the fences, but it\\'s a pretty spectacular whiff.', 'Preview [HD] I did not enjoy this rather silly comedy/musical. It did not hold my attention and I would not watch it if it were offered on Amazon Prime.  The actors spontaneously breaking out in song did nothing for me.  There are musicals out there that are worth the price and time to watch....but Browsers was not one of them.  I have never cared for Glee either, so I guess its just not my cup of tea when it comes to comedy/musicals in general.', 'I could only hack ten seconds of this show.

I'm not into musicals, and I can't stand the real Arianna Huffington, let alone a fictional one.\", \"Clearly not for me since I am not a Gleek or a fan of musicals in general.

We couldn't watch another minute.  Bad songs, bad dialogue, bad characters.\", 'I was embarrassed for the actors in this. The writers must have spent about 15 minutes on the concept and script, the songwriters maybe 5 minutes on trite, stupid, and clumsily trying to-, but failing to be clever lyrics with equally banal tunes.

Not a single thing original about this show. It misses the mark on all levels.', \"Writers and composers - musicals are HARD TO WRITE. A song cannot simply be words that rhyme and happen to have notes attached...they need, like any other story, depth, layers, actual people not just caricatures, and something we can relate to, then they need to have good music to help tell that story. When you have a seasoned Broadway and TV actress like Bebe Neuwirth unable to make it work, you're missing something. This is really painful.\", \"This was so incredibly annoying that I couldn't stand to keep watching. The singing was mediocre (I'm being nice), the lyrics were lame, and it was boring.\", 'From the get go, Browsers actually \\'warns\\' it\\'s viewers that it is a musical show.  If your goal is to immediately turn off 60% of your potential audience, then this is a great plan.  BeBe Neuwirth (Frasier\\'s Wife) is the star associated with this Amazon Original.  Her accent isn\\'t appealing.  I should note that i\\'m not a fan of music based shows, and this one, based upon interns at a news website, is not impressive.  Expect songs about internet meme\\'s that won\\'t have any meaning in a year.  Such as the horrible song \"When I Tweet\".  The Dance sequence at the end is just lame during a song that could be funny, but falls flat on an empty premise of a show.', 'There are a couple of tv shows with music successfully included in a drama and/or comedy show.  It always seemed to me they go downhill when the singing stops.  This pilot goes downhill from the opening song and either stays there or goes further down.  The songs and singing were mediocre.  The acting and writing was amateurish.  I am embarrassed for Bebe Neurwirth.  She deserves better but should also have known better than to allow herself to be dragged into this muck.  Perhaps out of work older actors have to take jobs beneath their skill level just like a lot of other workers in this economy. Sad.', \"Are they really singing? Really?

After a long stretch of this we see the same woman back with her stolid polar-opposite, square-jawed, decent, Oklahoma guy, a man of few words.  And he doesn't spin.  The woman's daughter, though, also frolics and spins with her arms out.  She's adorable, too, and has an adorable name, Tatiana, in case you missed the fact that she is adorable.  This goes on for quite a while.  The French woman tries to spin and dance for the guy in their house, using a scarf, but he is beginning to lose interest. She does manage to frolic and giggle when he puts the hose on her but that is short lived.  If only she could do something else...like cook or make conversation or read a book?  Her repertoire of tricks is limited to being adorable, spinning and sometimes biting....very feline and French I guess?Meanwhile Javier Bardem is a Spanish priest who is having a crisis of faith.  He is the most interesting character, so far and I had hopes that he might interject something of substance into this thin romance.  But even his presence didn't do it for me.  I was relieved when the French woman went home and the Affleck guy met a local girl.  She looked amazingly like the French one...same sweetheart face, petite body and long hair....only hers was blond.  And, thank God, she didn't spin around!  I had hopes for that duo but when she started giving her version of the same hard-luck story that the French woman delivered, I had enough.

In between are two mismatched characters who accidentally volunteer to go to a suspected rebel held planet for a reconnaissance.  There they run into a girl rebel who thinks they are also rebels (?).

Maybe I\\'m jaded, as someone who works in politics, but the scenarios and dialogue just weren\\'t believable (think \"All the President\\'s Men\" or \"The Ides of March\" or even the original \"The Manchurian Candidate\"), nor were they quite farcical enough to be recognizable as some sort of absurdist lampoon (think \"Airplane\" or \"Naked Gun\" or even \"Thank You For Smoking\"). This show is an attempted political comedy that takes itself and its ideological/partisan mission way too seriously. Political humor can be great, but, whether it\\'s on the right or left, it usually falls flat when it\\'s a vehicle for driving an underlying partisan agenda first and foremost. Good political comedy should be equal-opportunity offensive to both sides, or rather, to the system itself.SNL\\'s Weekend Update, The Daily Show, and its successors are at their funniest and most relevant when they first lay bare the truth about the butt of their joke fairly and in context, giving the subject of ridicule a chance to legitimately make his or her case, and THEN and only then mock the stupidity/bigotry/misguidedness relentlessly. Alpha House doesn\\'t give Republican viewpoints a fair hearing, nor does it add anything new to the world of political satire/parody. It just rehashes a bunch of junk that wasn\\'t funny the first hundred times it was done, and more importantly, it\\'s a chance to score partisan points primarily, and a vehicle for comedy only secondarily.That\\'s what this felt like, at least, watching the pilot. A vehicle for Garry Trudeau\\'s hyper-cynical, humorless, out-of-touch, leftist political agenda.Step one- Start by creating one-dimensional characters from the lamest and most overdone Republican stereotypes imaginable.Step two- Throw in some of the left\\'s contemporary pet political issues. Social issues and global warming.Step three- Create weak \"straw man\" arguments from the Republican characters to discredit the conservative side of these issues.Step four- Now try to make that mess funny.Get Garry Trudeau out of this project, and with the cast and concept, it\\'s probably a big hit. The next House of Cards, perhaps. Right now, though, no way does this catch on. Nor should it. Which is too bad, because John Goodman in particular does a fine job in his role, despite abysmal writing.', 'This show is insipid, humorless, ridiculous and a total failure. Do not waste your time.

Half of the nation votes Republican yet, Amazon comes out with a show that plays to the liberal talking points - just like all other Hollywood(Hollyweird) political shows do. This particular episode was over the top in this regard where the conservative character says things that are not really conservative. They are things that liberals think are conservative or things that liberals wish conservatives believed in. I like the show's characters, but I hate the politics of this show. If this keeps up, I am dropping the show from my watch list. My advice to Amazon: create a liberal-bashing show which would be a hit since there is NOTHING like that out there in the mainstream entertainment media. Or they could create a show that bashes both parties equally - that would also still be new and appeal to both political viewpoints.\", 'This show seemed like it had a lot of potential, but really fell short of my expectations. I thought Garry Tradeau might be able to put together a good story, but clearly his limits are confined to comic strips. The best part about the pilot was the Bill Murray cameo. Unfortunately, it doesn\\'t sound like he will be a recurring character. The humor really fell flat, and seemed forced at times. Knowing Tradeau\\'s comic strip, I was expecting him to take partisan shots at the GOP. It is really unoriginal, and an expected par for the course. It would have been interesting for him to think outside the box of his own political views, but that would require a much sharper mind. Also, Senators do not live like that in DC. Representatives will often times sleep in their offices in DC, but I have certainly never heard of a Senator rooming with three others. There is a serious lack of beltway and political knowledge on display in this show. Maybe \"Veep\" has set the bar too high for political comedies. I am a DC resident and political junkie, which is partly why I had hoped this would be a new show to watch. Nice try.

This movie, released in 3D (why?) is a bad remake of the Japanese film by the same title, directed by Ataru Oikawa from a script by himself, Takamasa Sato and Kei Oishi, which was adapted from the latter\\'s novel \"Ju-On\". The Japanese version, far superior to this rendition, is itself heavily influenced by (if not plagiarized from) \"Dark Waters\", \"The Ring\" and \"The Grudge\".\"Apartment 1303 3D\" is directed and produced by Michael Taverna, who also wrote the script, that has such memorable lines as \"\"Ugh, this apartment\\'s freaking me out!\" and \"Apartments don\\'t kill people. People kill people.\"The story happens in modern day Detroit, where a naive young woman (Janet) rents an affordable apartment with a dazzling panoramic view, in an old building. Janet (Julianne Michelle) is trying to assert her independence from her domineering, abusive alcoholic mother (Rebecca DeMornay) and moves out of the family home, which she also shared with older sister Lara (Misha Barton).Weird people inhabit the building and the apartment is haunted by an angry ghost that eventually murders Janet, faking a suicide. Lara and her married cop boyfriend Mark (Cory Sevier), investigate the circumstances of Janet\\'s death.

It was an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There was about 10 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie.2. Here&#8217;s V/H/S/2&#8221;. It is an anthology horror film, about some people that break into someone&#8217;s house in the middle of the night. They find a room of VHS tapes, and one person stays behind to watch the tapes, which turn out to be &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. There is about 5 minutes of interesting material in the whole movie..3. The first story is about a guy that gets a video camera for an eyeball, which lets him see dead people that move his video game controller and teapot. He meets a girl that got an electric ear, which lets her hear dead people, including her fat uncle. She has to take her clothes off to get him to leave. Together, they meet other dead people, who are mean.4. The second story is about a zombie attack. Now, you might think that a zombie attack, told from the point of view of a camera on a zombie, would be interesting. But you would be wrong.5. The third story is about a cult that waits until a documentary crew arrives before they go on a murderous rampage and give birth to a demon. The story makes absolutely no sense, but it&#8217;s the best story of the whole movie just because it has the most gore.6. The fourth story is about a group of teenagers that like to have sex and masturbate. But their fun is ruined when aliens invade their house and start killing them. This time, we know the whole terrible story because a camera was attached to the family dog.7. This movie underscores the problem with &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films. Everybody needs to be filming everything at all times. People need to have cameras in their eyes, on their bikes, on their helmets, in their clothes, in their house, in their car, and on their dog. And they need to all be filming 24/7. And once everybody is dead, someone has to find all the footage and edit it together into a story.8. If you think the &#8220;Paranormal Activity&#8221; films are documentaries, this movie might scare you. Otherwise you will laugh at the cheap effects, the cheap scares, and the cheap acting. Characters will think of the stupidest thing to do, and then do it. Not to mention the fact that each story barely has a plot, anyway.9. This movie proves that &#8220;found footage&#8221; horror films have not only jumped the shark, they&#8217;re not even in the water anymore.', \"Watched it coz Anna Kendrick is on it.

However, the series has degenerated into adrenaline-junkie fodder, and with no intellectual layers to the story line, there is nothing here but chaos. It feels more like a video game than a television show.\", 'Show started strong but then network saw its ratings were strong and decided to milk it for another season,  going off on tangents with minor characters, and the show just became stagnant and boring.', \"The town of Chester's Mill is sealed off from the rest of the world by an invisible dome. The inhabitants - and various visitors - have to manage dwindling supplies and social disorder whilst trying to figure out how to escape.We live in a golden age of television, with TV shows pushing further in crafting excellent narratives and creating compelling characters out of even the most mundane of situations. Rising budgets and production values mean that TV shows now often look like movies, sometimes with big movie stars opting for the less-lucrative but more creatively and artistically rewarding opportunities to slowly explore and develop characters over hours and maybe years. It's a great time to be a TV fan.Under the Dome therefore stands as a stark warning that we should not be complacent or overconfident that this is a state that will last forever. Under the Dome is a horrible show, so terrible that on a fundamental level all involved with it must know how bad it is, and therefore can only have made it deliberately as a warning to others to stay on the ball and avoid this show's pitfalls.Under the Dome is based on Stephen King's quite excruciatingly awful novel of the same name, but in a move that is actually impressive, is awful for completely different reasons. The primary weaknesses of King's novel - the ludicrous implausibility at how quickly everything disintegrates and its unhealthy obsession with raping Twilight fans (seriously Stephen, we know you're a Harry Potter fan but that's just juvenile) - are fortunately missing from the TV show. Brian K. Vaughan - the man credited with saving Lost from a dip in form during its early third season - has great credentials and is a good enough writer to know what to change from the book (i.e. almost everything apart from the dome itself and a few character names) to make it work on TV. But pretty much none of it does work.The biggest problem is the total lack of decent, compelling characters. Our main lead appears to be Dale 'Barbie' Barbara, but he is a rather unsympathetic killer and thug. Actor Mike Vogel initially gives it his all, but after a couple of episodes seems to realise that the inexplicable lurches in his character's motivations aren't going away and decides to sleep-walk through the rest of the series. Rachelle Lefevre also gamely engages with her character of Julia before realising she doesn't have a character, just a cliche (unconventional journalist from out of town with totally amazing hair), and likewise phones it in. The young kids are more enthusiastic and get some credit for being the only people in town actually bothered about what the dome is and where it came from, but their lack of experience and some poor direction results in them lurching from painfully over-acting to massively underselling big moments.There are some good points in the cast. Natalie Martinez's character of Linda has some bizarre character turns and is rather gullible at times, but she at least just about manages to sell the idea of a character cracking up from the stress of the situation (whether that was the aim or not). Dean Norris also brings some much-needed charisma to the antagonistic role of 'Big Jim' Rennie, even if some of his quite astonishing lines are delivered through teeth hugely gritted as he tries to forget he went from filming Breaking Bad to this mess (a drop in quality only comparable to Natalie Portman appearing in Black Swan and then Your Highness). However, the good work of others is undone by Alexander Koch as Junior. His utter lack of acting talent and the way he seems to have only three stand-by expressions he moves between, sometimes randomly, is almost hypnotic. It's certainly the worst performance by a regular in a TV series that I've seen in many, many years.The writing is also awful. Brian K. Vaughan has some seriously good work to his name, but he seems unable to employ it here. Dialogue is expositionary, unconvincing and wooden in the extreme. You can predict how entire scenes will go - sometimes down to lines - from their opening moments. The show also starts back-pedalling from its premise - a bunch of people trapped together in a dome - immediately by periodically bringing in new characters and unconvincingly explaining they've been in hiding since the dome came down. When the writing doesn't even have the courage to deal with the basic premise of the show, there's a huge problem.Under the Dome's first season (*) is almost irredeemably bad. The writing is almost completely bad, the acting is mostly bad, very little about it (from character motivations to the supply situation to the utter lack of contact with the outside world after the third or fourth episode) makes any kind of sense and the whole thing feels like a big, dead, inert weight. A few flashes of competence from a couple of the actors are the only thing that makes watching it even remotely bearable. Still, it's a vast improvement on the novel.\", \"The first couple of episodes were just okay. The most interesting part was when Junior locked the girl from the diner in his storm cellar. I was rooting for her to escape. But I had to turn episode 7 off when two females started kissing. To me, this is just a glorified attempt to get more ratings. The premise of the show was already good. The addition of this other stuff was unnecessary. They should focus on better acting and less sensationalism. Anyway, it wasn't enough to keep me watching. So, I'm done.\", 'The second episode told me I had wasted my time watching the first episode.  For fiction, to watch all these shows with no idea of how or why there is this dome and the implications was too much for me to continue watching.  These kind of shows are a cheap version of science fiction in which they can use some set of some farm somewhere without any special effects or imagination of any kind.  A cheap version of a good sci-fi movie.', \"Do they even know what a miniseries is?I can tell you, it doesn't have Seasons. This should have ended with episode 13. On that, (and pretty much the bad acting, nonsensical actions of the characters and horrendous dialogue)  I give this show a 1.\", \"This series feels overly contrived.

Like every &#34;average town&#34; in tv-land=a Los Angeles casting agency full of cutsey, dimpled Abercrombie & Fitch models.  The whole dome itself just isn't that interesting.  A similar concept was explored and adapted into a film in Stephen King's The Mist.  Being a film, the CGI is much better, and the cinematography was much more thrilling.  Maybe if Under the Dome was a miniseries, and on a network like HBO, it could have been something great.\", 'I like SciFi, a lot. It promotes forward thinking IMO.This series started out with a cool idea, of \"what if\".With Stephen King as the writer, and Steven Spielberg as the director, WOW, I was excited.Ouch. Ouch.  Arggh!

But the poor writing and 2 dimensional character of Big Jim (who should be called ironically slim jim on the basis that his character is homogenously distasteful and lacking of character) is disappointing.  This is not due to Norris\\'s shortcomings, because he was simply incredible in Breaking Bad.  It\\'s that Dome has a stupid story arc the writers lost somewhere in the filing cabinent...and to compensate, they drag their feet by creating a bunch of non-likable characters that undergo unimportant tribulations that do not contribute to moving the story along.  You kind of wish the series would be 2 episodes long and they\\'d all suffocate to death.This show is slower than Walking Dead for events to actually happen.  It makes you wait even longer than LOST. Are they expecting 12 seasons this time?The drama and interpersonal relationships are seriously flawed.  We don\\'t care about the red head and her problematic husband, or \\'barbie\\' (he\\'s a doll, get it?  Ew).  We don\\'t care about big jim (he\\'s evil.  got it.).  Or his son (he\\'s evil, but maybe..just maybe he could be good.  Got it--Boredom).  We don\\'t care about the son\\'s dramatic magical girlfriend.  Or the droll magical daughter of the two lesbians.  Or her nerdy teen leader brother.  Or anyone.  They are all terrible characters without any depth whatsoever.  The show focuses on them, and tries to make the dome as a metaphor for creating a microcosm in which these characters have to figure things out.  Only they go nowhere fast and they have no depth.I watch this show at 1.5x speed using VLC while reading reddit.  I can actually keep up with it.  Which means it\\'s not a smart show and it probably entrains people into drooling stupidly for an hour (I have the chest puddle to prove it).  It\\'s a show that is so slow it makes Walking Dead look exciting.  It makes you think the sheriff is talking way too fast to understand.  \"Nah downt cheeew goooh tew fer, nah boweh\"As far as story, it\\'s as potentially enticing as Failing Skies, but equally disappointing in the actual end-result.  As some have said on forums,  it\\'s not supposed to be 1/10 as good as 1980s V with Beastmasters Marc Singer!If these were our only choices, and there weren\\'t great HBO shows to balance them out, I would think this is the beginning of the end of the human race in a slow decline into idocracy.', 'OK. I don\\'t get it. I really gave this a shot but, after watching the very first episode I have officially given up on this one. The premise of an invisible dome covering a town is OK but cutting a cow in half was ridiculous. As soon as that happened I knew it was over. It\\'s not that any of the things  that happened in the show couldn\\'t happen but it\\'s just that everything was so cheezy. I give up on this one.

We feel that we were tricked into watching what we thought was a miniseries complete in itself. Instead, we see that Under the Dome is just another techno-soap opera with no real resolution in sight.

That's OK, because the book was even worse. But even though a lot happens in each episode, yet it seems like little forward motion in the story. It drags. And worst of all, the acting is truly awful in nearly all cases. Many good series with good writing, good stories, good actors get cancelled. They're going to renew this for a second season?

I have not read the SK book Under the Dome, but most reviews I have read indicate that in this case, the only similarity to the book is the names of the characters. Having said that, all I can add is that this seems to be a poorly written script combined with even poorer acting.  Forget about the \"effects\". If the writing and acting were good, they could carry the show on their own, but in this case, not even fantastic effects could save the show. Like I said, Not For Me.

This is not one of those times. Like most King translations, Under the Dome is extremely poor, and a tremendous letdown compared to the original material. The primary flaw with Under the Dome is the unbelievably poor acting. Only two actors are doing an acceptable job (Big Jim and his son), and neither of them are main characters. There are other problems as well, but that one alone is enough to make this series a definite \"pass\" to anyone who places value on decent acting.', \"Under the Dome [0558 - 07-18-2014]Summary:A small town is suddenly and inexplicitly sealed off from the rest of the world by a transparent dome. No communication can pass through the dome.Content & Packaging:4 disks - 13 episodes - standard DVD packaging. Several special features and few deleted scenes.Positive Comments: I bought this set used. I hope I can sell it to someone else - quickly.The Cast:With rare exception the ensemble cast for this show - Wiki lists 30 speaking roles - is uniformly bland and undistinguished. The most memorable character - a drug addled old preacher was killed off around episode 4. Dean Norris as &#34;Big Jim&#34; Rennie looks exhausted by the silly plots and dialogue he must contend with.Negative Comments: (where do I begin) Some of the worst plotted TV shows I have ever seen. For example a &#34;real cute guy&#34; working as debt collector for a bookie kills his client in a brawl. Quickly his digs a grave and buries the body just as the dome comes down with him inside. His victim's wife - she is real cute too - is frantic concerning her missing husband. Fast-forward a few episodes and the murderer is shacking up with the wife like nothing ever happened a couple of days ago - no remorse, no &#34;is this kinda weird' type conversations - I could go on and on. The few deleted scenes are at the end of disk 2, 3 & 4 but no reference is provided to the episode.

But the typical law enforcement officer is honest, and earnestly abides by the laws her/she is sworn to uphold. People who become cops because they like excitement, or power, or just want to feel like a bad ass, rarely last long on the job.

The film is just horribly boring.  It isn't worth the time it takes to watch it.\", 'Utterly devoid of entertainment value. Makes you long for the old end-of-day test pattern.', 'By now, it should be safe to assume that the majority of us have either seen or at least heard about the new space thriller, Gravity.  Arguably one of the best films of 2013, it\\'s safe to assume that (in the not so distant future) there will be a steady flow of space dramas coming our way in a cheap attempt to cash in on the massive success of Gravity.  Naturally, it\\'s no coincidence that the independent space drama, Europa Report, was released on home video just days after the release of the Bullock/Clooney blockbuster.Directed by Sebasti&aacute;n Cordero (Rage, Chronicles), Europa Report stars Embeth Davidtz as Dr. Unger, the head of a corporation that privately funds an outer space mission, Europa One, to investigate potential life on one of the moons of Jupiter.  In a documentary-style format and using various camera footage shot aboard the space shuttle, Unger tells the story of six astronauts that successfully land on one of Jupiter\\'s moon and attempt to research the surface, which is made partially of ice - a sign that the moon may inhabit life forms.  Anamaria Marinca, Karolina Wydra, Michael Nyqvist, Daniel Wu, Sharlto Copley, & Christian Camargo also star in supporting roles.Since Europa Report was conveniently released (on home video) on the coattails of Gravity, it warrants a quick comparison to the buzz-worthy blockbuster.  If we use the opinion of James Cameron, who called Gravity \"the best space film ever done,\" Europa Report could easily be called the worst space film ever done.  Much like the great unknown of outer space, these types of films obviously thrive on the simple premise that anything that could wrong will go wrong.  Feel free to look for an outer space flick in which everything is all hunky-dory for its entirety - and in the event that such a film did exist, it would most likely be the equivalent of watching paint dry.  In any event, while Gravity thrived largely due to beautiful visuals, above average thrills, A-list actors, and an easily understandable plot, Europa Report nearly fails in comparison in each and every category.It\\'s painfully evident that Europa Report lacks a clear and comprehensible direction in regards to who the characters are and what their particular purpose is over the course of this film.  Obviously, Daniel Wu portrays the captain, but at no point does he ever appear to be in command of anything.  These actors and actresses are completely devoid of emotion, dimension, and for lack of a better word - interest.  If the point of this film was to be a documentary-style flick in which viewers were not supposed to care about the characters within it, then it was a smashing success.  But, as far as the entertainment value of the character development, this film is absent of potential.  These characters, portrayed by completely unrecognizable actors and actresses, simply go through the motions of the script, which is nearly a full hour and a half of bumbling around a space shuttle.The most bothersome aspect of the film is the constant jumping from bad camera view to bad camera view.  Unfortunately, this style of film-making deprives the film of a smooth delivery, directly stemming from the space cams, which take away the experience of watching a movie and turn this film into an outer space version of big brother.  One minute you\\'ll be watching the crew eat dinner and then you\\'ll suddenly be viewing a swing arm and solar panels in outer space - as if they will eventually come into meaning (which they don\\'t).  In a noble act, this film sticks with the documentary-style of storytelling, but just when scenes attempt to pick up, they are quickly broken up by random analysis from spectators (presumably on Earth) who attempt to explain the fallout and existential circumstances of the Europa One mission.  When you combine aspects, they make for a frustrating viewing experience.While the film\\'s execution is overly frustrating, the story is still on the money in terms of how humanity might one day approach space exploration.  To be honest, there\\'s nothing sexy about this film and is a far cry from some of the sci-fi flicks moviegoers have been spoiled with in recent years, like Prometheus, Star Trek, or Moon.  Still, the authenticity of Europa Report is admirable - as it clearly aims to depict a film that would dwarf the magnitude of the moon landing.  The significance of this story is there, but the emotion is years beyond comprehension, because when/if the day comes that life is discovered on another planet, people might just look back on this film and make a distinct comparison.Overall, Europa Report is a dismal and disappointing movie to sit through.  Realistically, all you need to know about this film is that six astronauts land on a moon orbiting Jupiter and then fast-forward to the last twenty minutes - where you\\'ll finally \"see the light.\"  You\\'ll miss absolutely nothing of relevance, regardless of what happens to the characters along the way.  The climax of this film is it\\'s only saving grace, thus preventing it from earning a complete failing grade.  For a film that\\'s supposed to be thrilling, one could only assume that the most thrilling portions of this film were left on the cutting room floor.  Any other explanation would lead you to believe that the writers and filmmakers suffer from sheer incompetence when it comes to making an entertaining film.  Do yourself a favor and don\\'t even bother giving this film a chance.  The brief 90 minutes of your life which it would cost you to watch this film (along with money presumably) will surely be better spent doing absolutely anything else.GRADE:  D-FNDNreview.com', \"This &#34;movie&#34; which is shot like a made-for-television movie from the 1960's, is slow moving, boring, and uneventful.

And the writers did a good job, for a while. But - and this is what gave it moral weight - it was also about clients. Clients. That\\'s right, real people, non-attorneys in danger from the law, who needed very good representation to win them justice.Then, as season 2 ground on, this show became only about the war-ing egos WITHIN the law firm, the jostling for power that the writers just make up the rules for as they go along - and it had so many twists and turns that no outcome was ever earned dramatically. It became like watching a bunch of smart alecks exchanging zingers - the equivalent of teenage boys in an alley saying, \"No,YOUR mother eats golf balls.\" Or whatever. Gabriel Macht (Harvey) is a very watchable actor, but the writers no longer give his character anything that means more to him than his own vanity. Patrick J.

Don't waste your time or $10 like I did.\", 'A game British cast and co-writer of Sacha Baron Cohen movies in the director&#8217;s chair, led to this movie described as a &#8216;reverse rom-com&#8217; by some.  It&#8217;s laudable to attempt a spin on the worn out premises rolled out time and time again in Hollywood rom-coms, and the cast seem well suited to their roles.  We have the central couple who we see at the start embarking on their marriage, their bitter and unhappily married friends, a best friend / best man who reaches new heights of inappropriateness and lack of social graces, and an ex girlfriend of the groom.  As the movie rumbles on, with some blackly comic moments which may bring a guilty smile to your face, we are gradually introduced to the idea that this couples marriage is keeping them from the romances they really should be in.  As the conclusion becomes more inevitable, sadly, blackly inventive comedy becomes just irritatingly condescending and insulting. Counselling is portrayed as a ridiculous waste of time,  and the lies the couple tell each other are poked fun at.  Perhaps the worst indictment of a romantic comedy is that none of the leads are particularly likeable.  It&#8217;s really hard to care about whether they find their true love as depicted in the movie, and if anything we the audience have more investment in the marriage, flawed as it is, which leaves a sense of disappointment that they need to take the easy way out for the movie to reach its pat resolution.  And therein lies the insult.  The idea of a couple fighting to save their marriage is seen as futile, insulting all those who have succeeded in getting over their difficulties and finding happiness together, and the idea of a divorce is seen as a romantic light throwaway moment, insulting all those who have experienced directly or indirectly a divorce.  So yes, there are humourous moments, and Minnie Driver&#8217;s scabrous friend whose answers during charades give away everything but the answers is a highlight, but the humour always feels at a cost, and ultimately the movie does nothing to make you feel good and ultimately the laughs are hollow.Of course, there is always an audience for a movie.  For this movie, if you have a cynical streak about romance, believe that divorce is a worthy goal and that marriage is a singularly failed institution that kills true love, then this IS the movie for you.

According to the newest installment, it makes perfect sense that Auggie was actually a CIA operative FIRST in 2006, THEN joined the military, where he was blinded in 2007, and then went back to the CIA. Yeahhhhh, that's definitely a totally believable career progression. I mean, at this rate, the details of this season border on sci-fi. And Piper Perabo's acting is getting more and more stilted, making you think that she's planning her own exit or bored to tears with the script. RIDICULOUS.=============================================================================================================================ORIGINAL REVIEW:I've been watching this show from the beginning, and was already a little apprehensive about the somewhat predictably lame season 3 ending of Auggie and Annie falling into bed together (SNORE!). But I was completely unprepared for just how BAD this season would be. Not only does their relationship take center stage - right along with little inserts of the crumpled, limping relationship between Arthur and Joan who, surprise surprise, TV once again manages to produce a miracle and makes her pregnant at whatever age she's supposed to be (the actress herself being 43).I'm not sure what's worse in the show so far: the incredibly AWFUL, bad, awkward relationship between Auggie and Annie - replete with some of the worst cliches and stale lines you remember from bad 70s and 80s movies - that's so embarrassingly bad that you're variously wondering how the acting in a show can get WORSE with continuing seasons whent the actors should now be firmly entrenched in their characters, or think that it's as awkward as watching a real life brother-sister team fake a romantic relationship (yuck). Yes, it's THAT bad.And while there are the occasional moments when the show briefly returns to its former gusto, the thrills and suspense of previous seasons are few and far between. Mostly you witness Piper Perabo acting like she just got off the bus in Hollywood yesterday (and, let's face it, she's come a long way since Coyote Ugly) - and one can only hope that real spies have better skills than her because when you see scenes where she strolls around like Bambi, blissfully unaware of all the DANGERS!! around her, always waiting for some guy to rescue her...it's so groan-worthy that you just want to throw a well-heeled shoe at the tv and yell MAKE THEM STOP!All of those things just seem to be distractions from a lack of well-written storylines that initially drew me - and presumably others - to this show, which now stumbles clumsily from one eye-roll-inducing scene to the next.The show seems to have become a really tragic hybrid between a bad episode of Law & Order and a day-time soap - if it wasn't for the fact that I've got cable and the other shows I enjoy watching are on hiatus until the fall, I wouldn't be giving this the time of day at all anymore. I keep hoping that it'll get better, but so far it's just one bad episode after the next.\", \"I watched an episode of this to see what it was all about. How in the world did this family get a reality show? and whats worse....is WHO would watch it.?? There are good shows with excellent writers, and it's hard to believe that our entertainment is going in this direction.\", 'When the savagely distasteful reviews for &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; dropped earlier this year, I was baffled.  I mean, &#8216;Drive&#8217; was pretty much critically applauded and continues to earn raves from cinephiles, and Ryan Gosling is kind of like beloved by nearly everyone (I said nearly), so how in the world could the much anticipated follow-up to their surprise masterpiece be such a terrible film?  I chucked it up people just not &#8216;getting it&#8217; and figured that they MUST be wrong.Nicolas Winding Refn couldn&#8217;t have dropped the ball THAT far, could he?You can go ahead and sound the alarm, because the world that hated &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was correct and pretty much hit every nail on the head.  I&#8217;m just as baffled as the ten other people who have yet to see this (I&#8217;m always late to the party), but believe me, this film is atrocious in ways I can&#8217;t even put into words.  I&#8217;m almost loathe to admit that I liked anything about this movie (the cinematography is gorgeous, the costumes are divine and that score is Oscar worthy) simply because the overall product is so dreadful.I am an advocate for the whole mantra &#8216;less is more&#8217;.  I love a subtle and inviting flow to a film because that slow burn allows the characters and the plot to thrive, unravel and blossom.  &#8216;Drive&#8217; had that, despite what you may think.  I think that was a chief complaint from the movie going public, since they were anticipating another &#8216;Fast and the Furious&#8217; and wound up getting something much slower, deeper and darker.  When I read the countless reviews complaining that &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; was too slow, too vacant or too quiet I actually thought that the critics were experiences a bad case of memory loss.  Didn&#8217;t we go through this already two years ago?  Don&#8217;t you know that Refn&#8217;s films are NOT what they appear but so much more than they appear?Memory loss or not, those complaints are legit.That is my biggest issue with &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; and a chief complaint I had with another film I saw recently (&#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;).  In fact, I foolishly watched those films back to back and I felt like I was watching a double feature on absolutely nothing.  Where &#8216;Drive&#8217; developed not only an intricate plot but a protagonist who felt real and crushing, &#8216;Only God Forgives&#8217; forgets to develop much of anything.  Instead, we are given scattered characters who say very little and only know how to emote a singular expression (I&#8217;m still not sure what that expression is, although I strongly feel that it could be constipation) and then one broadly stroked caricature who has all the obvious clich&eacute;s of the &#8216;monster mom&#8217; and yet none of the grounding to make her feel real, believable or even remotely entertaining (I love you Kristen, but what are you doing here?).  The plot itself is another &#8216;shrug of the shoulders&#8217; as it fails to be interesting or gripping but instead serves as a blank canvas for the characters to inflict horrific bodily pain on others and for the effects department to produce large amounts of fake blood.Gosling plays a man named Julian, a drug-smuggler living in Bangkok.  The film&#8217;s opening sequences portray Julian&#8217;s unstable brother butchering a young prostitute and then being beaten to death by her father.  Julian&#8217;s unhinged mother shows up to bury her son and exact revenge on the men responsible for her son&#8217;s death, including a sadistic police officer.  Julian doesn&#8217;t want to get involved, but his mother is a whirlpool and he&#8217;s soon getting beaten up by the cop and avenging his mother.At least I think so.There are so many distasteful things about this movie, and so many lazy aspects.  I didn&#8217;t expect Refn to pen such a poorly constructed disaster, but his script is so bare and so unintelligent, and the barely there dialog doesn&#8217;t help any.  I think Gosling says about ten things, and he doesn&#8217;t wear any expression on his face but that of &#8216;deep concentration&#8217; (or constipation, as I mentioned already) and so you really get no handle on who this man is.  Many scenes in the film feel so unnecessary or not even that but more pointless or ridiculous (as in, they don&#8217;t belong).  The relationship between Julian and his mother is never fleshed out and so it winds up feeling put upon and laughable, especially when he subjects a prostitute to dinner with his tactless mother (seriously, remind me again why he wants her to meet his mother), bares up under his mother&#8217;s insults and then berates his date (at least he shifts his facial features long enough to scream), demanding she take off the dress he purchased for her.I don&#8217;t think I can count the amount of times I stared at the screen, completely lost as to why anything that was going on was going on because nothing really &#8216;was&#8217; going on.Much like &#8216;To the Wonder&#8217;, I&#8217;m left wondering if the bulk of this film is sitting on the cutting room floor somewhere, and if so, why didn&#8217;t someone take the editor out and shoot them?  I mean, this can&#8217;t be the film Refn intended to release, right?  Is this his idea of a joke?  Maybe he intended to create something so hideous and so nonsensical that it could only be considered genius, because there really is no other explanation for it.Guess what Nicolas; you&#8217;re plan didn&#8217;t work!', \"According to wikipedia dot org, it's a 2013 French-Danish co-production crime thriller film written and directed by Nicolas Winding Refn. It was shot in Bangkok, Thailand.According to indiewire dot com, director Refn confirmed the cost of this movie was a little bit more than $5 millions.The worst thing about this movie was all main characters were emotionless. They did not express any emotion with their faces and words at all. It's as if they had been wearing masks. For example, the main policeman, he brutally killed some bad guys but his face was like a stone from the beginning till the end of the film. He did not show any anger or hatred.On top of that, there were very few dialogues. This made the problem worse.It's almost like a silent movie. For the first 10 minutes, it held my attention by forcing me to guess what would come next. Then, it became boring and tiring because I had to constantly try to interpret what the director wanted to convey with his video. It did not connect with me. It did not stir up any emotion. I did not care what happened to all the people. What's the point of watching a movie without feeling anything? In this regard, this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It's an example of how to make a bad movie.There are so many illogical holes and too much violence that make it less entertaining. For example, the scene where the assassin fired his machine gun into the small restaurant where the 3 policemen were eating. The policemen flipped the wooden table they're eating at and used it as a shield. Miraculously, no bullets hit the table. Yeah!The violence was so over-the-top that it became sadistic. For instance, there was a scene where the policeman poked the eye of a bad guy with a pointed metal stick. He also thrust it into the guy's ear.Almost everything was in slow motion. Even the scene where the policeman chased the assassin was in slow motion. At first, this technique drew my attention. Then, it quickly became irritating.The hand-to-hand fighting scene between Ryan and the policeman was so childish it's laughable. Ryan was not suitable as an action actor.UPDATED Aug. 19, 2013According to boxofficemojo dot com, below are the financial figures of this film:Release Date: July 19, 2013Domestic:  $765,400+ Foreign:  $8,977,609= Worldwide:  $9,743,009So, it's a big flop in North America. No, I CAN'T FORGIVE this movie.In short, it's a waste of time and money.\", \"See I really liked and got the whole point of Drive. I really did enjoy the film this though on the other hand I hated with a passion which is the directors follow up film. Literally the movie makes no sense to me except that Gosling's brother gets killed by a crazy vigilante type cop because his brother is doing some very bad things ( oh ya and to mention everyone in this movie is not likeable and I could not stand any of them. They are all psychos and what not). So gosling takes it upon himself to seek out some revenge.

I feel like if I could have written the script for this show, you're in trouble.  Not worth the money.\", 'Boo.Whenever I see ratings on films, I am interested mostly in two particular scenarios:  critics go all Gaga -- and that ain\\'t the Lady -- over a film; or critics pan a film entirely.  Usually, if it is the former, it means that it is \"safe\" for the critics to like it; it is perhaps some family-friendly garbage that everyone should love, which means that it\\'s probably not very interesting in any way.  Conversely, if it is the latter, it means that it is not \"safe\" for critics to like it, because perhaps, someone like Lindsay Lohan is starring; and hating Ms. Lohan is completely acceptable because she\\'s the kicking girl du jour.  Hey, critics are Lemmings too, just like the American public.Well, in this case, the critics mostly got it right, but not because of Ms. Lohan.  No one here had anything to work with, including her.  This film is completely forced, in writing and in action.  Immediately, the opening scene is exceedingly painful to watch, as you see some 20-somethings act in the way that everyone expects 20-somethings to act; in other words, in unnatural ways.  Oh, and then it only gets worse in even more unnatural ways.I will admit, I didn\\'t watch the entire film.  As a matter of fact, I turned it off after about 20 minutes.  None of the characters are sympathetic -- every film must have at least one character that you will root for, and here I see none -- so this film failed immediately in that department.  And I saw no reason to continue watching.What was the purpose of this film?  Well, you\\'ve got me; I have no clue.  I give a big pass on a film that never should have been made.  I am going zero stars today on the worst disaster of a film created in years.', 'There are bad movies that make you angry. There are bad movies that make you laugh. And then... there are bad movies that make you feel a little depressed and icky, but mostly just bored.\"The Canyons\" is the last kind -- a hollow low-budget melodrama that begins and ends with empty pretension. It has roughly the same kind of story (shallow rich people, sex, murder) that Bret Easton Ellis has been writing for the past several decades, centering on a rapidly deteriorating Lindsay Lohan and her smoker\\'s croak.Rich brat/movie producer Christian (James Deen) is in a relationship with Tara (Lohan), an aging party-girl who desperately wants the financial security he gives her. Every night, Christian brings in other people (both male and female) to have sex with Tara while he watches, and sometimes they participate in group sex.Tara convinces Christian to cast struggling actor/bartender Ryan (Nolan Gerard Funk) in his latest schlock movie -- without mentioning that Ryan is her ex-boyfriend, and that she\\'s having a secret affair with him. But Christian suspects what Tara and Ryan are up to -- and he sets out to destroy his rival in any way possible. Even murder.Even before it was made, \"The Canyons\" was overshadowed by the forces behind it -- it was written by Ellis, directed by Richard Schrade, and starred the perennial train-wreck Lindsay Lohan in her \"comeback.\" What was more, the movie was funded by Kickstarter and distributed on VOD. This movie could have been on the vanguard of the new wave of entertainment production...... but to do that, it would have to be good. And it\\'s not. Instead it feels like Ellis is running on empty, so he\\'s regurgitating pallid knockoffs of the shocking, controversial kind of stories that he\\'s written about in his books. It\\'s like a Xerox of a Xerox of a Xerox, and it just leaves me wondering why he was so desperate to make this movie.Bless Richard Schrader, he\\'s trying to do SOMETHING with this mess, but doesn\\'t seem to know what. The plot aimlessly wanders around, following Tara and Christian in their little cat-and-mouse game, having awkwardly unsexy sex and boring us into a stupor with the stilted, hackneyed dialogue. As the final indignity, they try to throw \"twists\" into it, but they are either nonsensical or predictable.So it\\'s a bad movie. But it\\'s not the hilariously awful, awkward train-wreck that people wanted. It\\'s too good to be hilarious like \"The Room,\" but too bad to be watchable.It\\'s also kind of sad that the best performance (no double-entendre intended) comes from a porn actor. Actually, James Deen is really, really good as Christian -- a cold, dead-eyed sociopath who has wells of white-hot fury inside him. He loves no one, and sees everyone who isn\\'t easily controllable (like Tara) as an obstacle.Sadly, Deen is the best actor here. Funk is painfully out of his depth here. And Lohan is effectively playing herself, though not very well -- an aging, damaged party girl who lives off the largesse of rich men because she couldn\\'t cut it as an actress. You can practically see her crumbling away in front of your eyes, with her ravaged face and croaking voice. It adds a poignancy to her performance that her affected acting sadly can\\'t supply.\"The Canyons\" is a movie that feels like a halfhearted effort from everyone involved, except the scarily empty-eyed Deen. It\\'s not bad enough to be entertaining, and too bad to be enjoyable.', \"Once again, a real trouper like Lindsay Lohan can act, even if it is in dreck like this.  Believe it or not, as bad as this film was, it was Lohan that rose above the material.  I'm not a fan of hers, however, she does have talent.  Now if she could only get her stuff together and get a real part in a real movie.\", \"I don't comprehend the moral or the massage the producers were trying to send by making this movie. I also don't much understand the plot line really. Saying that it doesn't seem very entertaining to compensate for the lousy plot either so either way you're wasting your time.First of all, The actors are lame! Lindsey Lohan who's supposed to be the marketing ploy of this film is playing Tara a gold digger who exchanged her humble roots for a life of luxury even if it was costing her true happiness and safety. Supposedly, Tara is living with Christian a psychopathic maniac with mental problems we come to find out he has a shrink and a tendency to organize orgies at his apartment where he forces his Girlfriend Tara to participate in for the sake of his entertainment and then video tapes the sex sessions also for his pure entertainment. However, his odd behaviors and the fact that he's a controlling jerk didn't stop Tara from continuing her relationship with him after all he has money. Then enters Ryan Tara's ex boyfriend and her true love into the picture, now he is dating Christian's assistance and unbeknown to her or Christian these two ex love birds spark an affair in which Tara helps Ryan get the lead role for a small movie Christian is producing. Anyways, the whole movie is a cat/mouse chase between keeping the affair secret from Christian, Christian suspecting it, spying on Tara, trying to destroy Ryan, having sex with random strangers and eventually succeeding in his quest for destroying Ryan who is broke and living under the roof of his current girlfriend with barely any money and yet somehow manages to live a pretty well off lifestyle if you ask me.All these characters seem to think about is money and sex and I mean all of them without any exceptions. Ryan objects strongly to the way Tara is living her life by leeching off a rich boyfriend and being untrue to her real self all the while he's doing the same exact thing by living off his Gf's house. Tara has two guys being overly obsessed about her and is described as very beautiful however Lindsey Lohan due to years of alcohol and drug abuse has totally ruined her natural looks and in this movie looks a lot older than her 27 years. She has so much surgery done to her face as well she looks fake and in no way beautiful as the producers would want us to believe not in a way that would generate such attention anyways. She did seem comfortable playing her role but then again it wasn't a very good role if you ask me. Not one that I was impressed by, you don't want to be playing a man's sex toy for a comeback role. The writing was mediocre it's almost like the writers make fun of their own movie by having Lindsey Lohan tell the actor played by Ryan that him being in a small movie won't make a difference anyways and since it is a low budget film then what'd you know? Oh the irony!In the end I felt like this was a let's pass time by because we're bored movie rather than an actual let's make a movie we are passionate about movie. Also, in many ways I felt like the Christian character who's obsessed with orgies and sex as well as occasional murder is much like Christian Bale's character in American Psycho except this is the inferior version.Sorry Lindsey Lohan make next time you can pick a better role to play as your breakthrough role. This movie much like the writers have you mention will get you no where and maybe go slow on the Botox and add more emotions to your acting. You did seem bored.\", \"I've seen hardcore porno movies with FAR superior stories, characters, dialog, acting and directing than this POS.  This so-called movie fails on ALL accounts.  Hard to believe once-talented people like Ellis, Schrader and Lohan could make total crap like this.  A sad sad end to otherwise notable careers.  Avoid this miserable failure of a &#34;movie&#34; at all costs.\", \"I've been waiting a year to see this episode by Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Dana Priest (and Jim Gilmore) about her year-long investigation into the new secret government infrastructure with all the gory details.  This revealed very little about that.  Only about 10% of the episode's time was devoted to where these sites are, how they are funded, how they work with local law enforcement, what they are doing, etc..  The vast majority of the time is spent rehashing the events that led up to this situation with all of the bureaucrats and government officers telling us how patriotic they are and why they were justified to take the gloves off and do anything they wanted beating us over the head with their rhetoric.  I suspect that Priest's story was compromised by the governmental players to water down the theme and impact this story deserves.  What a disappointment.  I suppose I will have to read Dana's book to get the full story.

They also went &#34;old school&#34; and seemed to have a pretty decent moral compass.The van, the barber chair, the love of chili, the interactions of the characters were good enough at the time to keep me entertained (I was a kid, didn't take a lot, sue me.)The whole stuck in the wheelchair thing got in the way of a good story a lot back in the day.Today's version, none of the characters to me were likeable (and granted I only watched about 2/3 of the original pilot), nothing to really latch onto emotionally and you were left with the feeling that this Ironside had no problem bending the rules and of course the plots generally twisted to provide a rationale for what was done.They also seemed hellbent on making the guy in the wheelchair some sort of ninja hero with mad skills that he still maintained.The stories? Didn't seem like they had a real handle on where they wanted to go.  Was this a straight up (well, sitting down) wheelchair driven cop show?  Murder mystery?  Certainly no comedic elements in what I saw.General lack of balance (serious vs comedy) no one to really root for, I turned it off and went back and rewatched Sherlock.\", 'Totally stupid show .

Like others have stated, there was no true plot here; the movie was 43 minutes long, and in my book that wasted 40 minutes of my time.  Thankfully I didn't waste any cash on this movie as it was a freebie from my Amazon Prime account.  The only &#34;actor&#34; I cared about at all, was the little CGI alien critter they nicknamed &#34;Rat.&#34;  He didn't have much screen time, but he was cute enough to dominate whatever shots he was in, sort of made me think of a miniature Dobby (Harry Potter series) with a tail.

The Blacklist tells the story of brave Federal agents stopping terrorists (usually violent domestic activists bent on killing people, unlike the real-life domestic activists who are mostly non-violent). The agents also spend time at a black ops site where there are no prisoners, no cages, and no torture, again unlike real black ops sites. Like children playing war, the agents race here and there defeating bad guys. It has lots of action and little reflection. So, it shouldn't be surprising that it is mainly based on empty stereotypes. The one bright spot is James Spader's character. He is the father of the female lead (though we haven't been told this yet) and he may, or may not, be an international terrorist. The mystery around this character, and Spader's acting, are compelling, but not enough to overcome the lack of development of the other characters, the silly writing, and the children's tale that is The Blacklist.\", 'This series so far is nothing but exhibitions of gratuitous violence coupled with the machinations of an evil genius played by James Spader who week after week knows everything.

Plus, beating up someone because they are gay, again, really?  What is it 1980s Texas.  It is not even like they were beating up a kid.  It was a man.  Then and finally, the girl was talking to the guy saying &#34;were not in high school anymore.&#34;  I mean, what's it been 6 months since they graduated?  Maybe it has been longer.  They keep having the freaking people come back.  On top of all that, oh, sorry if I said that was the last thing, for a long time, none of the kids live like high school kids.

After hearing all this great stuff, I thought I should jump in! On a day off, I caught a marathon on TBS. I watched about 4 episodes, didn't find them funny, so I decided it wasn't for me. Recently I won a season in my office's white elephant. I thought I would maybe give it another try, because maybe the episodes I saw where just from when the show was in a dry patch. I popped this disk in, I watched all 7 episodes on that disk, and I didn't laugh once. The problem I have with this show, is that it doesn't really make you think, unlike so many other shows out there such as Arrested Development, Parks and Rec, and Community you don't have to think. The jokes are simple and all the jokes are just 'stand-in jokes' and none of the jokes &#34;come out of the charecters.&#34; I know that was kind of hard to understand haha, but the charecters just don't really feel real., How they portray Asperger's is unbelievably off, they portray people with that disease to be self-centered and really not care for anyone. I have a very close family member that has that disease and he is very kind and not as extreme as that character is. If you wanna see a good portrayal of that disease watch Parenthood or Community.  and how &#34;geeky&#34; they are. The overwhelmingly loud laugh track ruins the show, and the acting is just awful.

The trusty Gov\\' had already beheaded the second-most annoying character in our cast; now he was on the verge of truly freeing us from earnest tragic overload...But they KILLED him off. When it began, \"Walking Dead\" was great fun, because it reveled in the things that a good horror story can do. The guy trapped under the tank surrounded by zombies was just what we want with our popcorn. But it slowly morphed into this preachy tale of whining, goody-goody characters who are always worried about morality. These solemn, sermonizing bores. Horror is supposed to set us free, by loosing our demons. We want mayhem. We want people to do the wrong things for the wrong reasons. We want the savage battle of the instinctual. Let\\'s face it, normal life is so stifling; we civilized folks have to hide our inner thoughts and desires, but in good horror stories they are given free rein and we can relax and laugh at how awful we just might be. The Governor was the only character who made this series feel alive. When he came back on the scene, we were enthralled, because we never know what he will do next - but we know it will be ruthless, amoral, and will serve his compulsion to defend HIS people against anyone else\\'s people.So they kill him off, apparently because \"right\" must win. He should have mowed down the whole tiresome Rick community, taken over the prison, and then eventually been annihilated by some bigger force -- either a more powerful \"Governor\" type or a plague of zombies. He can die in the end (like Mr. Hyde, like the werewolf in so many movies, like Dracula) but WHEN he dies, that has to be it. That\\'s a wrap. Curtains. Instead we have the always sad, solemn, struggling, pathetic, moral, but above all boring Rick leading us into ever more maudlin pathways.The premise of the walking dead, after all, is preposterous. That brain tissue in this kind of dilapidated state, let alone starved for any nourishment, could animate a human body is beyond silly. And that\\'s fine, that\\'s what makes it okay to let our demons romp. But to try to stitch a serious story to such a premise is really inept. You can\\'t have people agonizing over fine moral dilemmas and then going down to the fence to stab rotting heads with sticks. Please, writers, get it together. The premise just won\\'t bear this pretentious level of drama. You have to keep a certain tongue in cheek.If I want Kumbaya, agonized soul-searching, or a pep talk for the United nations, I\\'ll watch a documentary or a drama. But this is horror.

What does it matter when there is no longer any clear reasons to live accept, like the zombies, to just keep on going? I guess the character of Carol was supposed to really embody that?

Whether it\\'s a dynamic as hell character like Shane or whether it\\'s some pouty-faced manchild obsessed with commandeering a family. Who cares?

For a found footage film it didn't make me sea sick with the shakey cam work like most seem to do and some of the steady cam shots of the landscape were nicely shot.There is tension between the two guy's for obvious reasons and makes you wonder what was the girl thinking. For me that was the most intriguing part of the whole story because the rest consisted of some conversations between the three,a road trip, a visit to a pub for a background on the story from the locals point of view, a hike to the woods with cows, sheep and horses, the camp site, more conversation, a chase, camp again, another chase, camp yet again and the the last chase THE END.There is some violence and little blood, very little suspense or tension, a make out scene that turns ugly and some foul language with no nudity.THIS IS AN IDEAL MOVIE FOR KIDS TO WATCH,  WHO YOU CAN'T SEEM TO GET TO FALL ASLEEP NO MATTER WHAT YOU HAVE TRIED.

This show has become a tumor on the collective television body of entertainment.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.', \"Note: I saw up the first four or five episodes of this show via XFinity On Demand in HD.After a suspenseful, shocking, exciting, harrowing and quite literally edge-of-your-seat season finale, I had high hopes for Season III. But they were dashed by spoilers on Facebook ruining the first few episodes with 'spoiler-free' teasers, and a shocking bit of switchhitting that occured towards the end of the fourth or fifth episode. Right then and there, I decided to stop viewing the show.Previously, the switchhitting had only been implied through discreet camera angles or a quick cut to another scene, but this was the first time anything like that had been openly shown on camera, and I was horribly disappointed.ABC, you screwed up big-time. Shame on you not only for openly allowing this filth to be shown on screen, but also in letting Mike Kelley go. I doubt he'd approve of the way you've let his show go down the drain into muck.\", \"I saw the trailer for this flick months ago and it made me want to see more. I wanted to love it, but the plot and poor acting made it almost unbearable to sit through. I applaud the fil makers for their work although I still believe Disney is behind the movie somehow.

I'd save your money and spend it elsewhere.\", \"The best part of this robotically acted, go nowhere storyline was the use of black & white filming. (That's suppose to be a funny.)Of all the ways to juxtapose going to Disney when you're a kid and then again as an adult w/kids this was not well executed. For some reason Dad is just as interested in gawking at two 14 year old girls (who tease him on) and who seem to always show up in the scenes (on rides, standing in line, eating, etc.) and was tediously boring.\", 'I really wanted to like this movie.

Yawn.\", \"Dario Argento takes a dump on Bram Stoker's classic story with this amateurish, cheap and dull production of Dracula.  Argento has never been known for thought-provoking cinema, and more often than not his stories feature an abundance of style over substance.  Here, even the style comes off as schlocky and cheesy, and not in a &#34;so bad it's good&#34; way either.  The entire cast doesn't speak English as a first language, and it shows in their performances.  With few exceptions, they all come off as stiff and wooden, with lifeless line readings.  Even Rutger Hauer, who has given some terrific performances in his career, is on auto-pilot here.  The only actor in the entire cast who really looks like he's enjoying himself is Thomas Kretschmann, who plays the titular Count.  And at times, it looks and sounds like he's doing his best Bela Lugosi impression.  Moving on, as this is a horror movie from Argento, it can be expected that there is a certain amount of blood and gore (along with some amusing female nudity).  While it certainly delivers in that department, the effects still look cheap and fake.  Also worth mentioning for how bad it is, the whole production has the look and feel of a made-for-TV drama, in everything from the staging and camerawork to the image quality.  A lot of the sets look like sets, and the CGI background enhancements in some scenes is jarring.  The visual effects are also disappointingly bad.  I already mentioned the blood and gore, but there's also a poorly done effect of bodies turning to ash as well as a laughably bad (but incredibly short) scene where Dracula attacks someone in the form of a (CGI) praying mantis(!).  On that note, in this movie Dracula doesn't just take the form of a bat, but also flies, roaches, wolves(?) and the aforementioned praying mantis.  Finally, even though I saw this in 2D, it was actually made for (and shot in) 3D.  Other than being a marketing gimmick, I can't possibly see how it would have benefited this piece of tripe.  Overall, it's best just to avoid this &#34;so bad it's horrible&#34; movie.  There are much better camp classics, and/or Dario Argento films if you're so inclined.\", 'Look, I totally get that Dario Argento has a devoted fan-base and so I am not writing this review to insult either the director or his followers but rather for unwary horror fans (like me) that might be confused by so many glowing reviews found on this page.\"Argento\\'s Dracula\" really kept me guessing on just how to view it; i.e. is it trying to be legit horror or campy, shoestring budget, fictional cloning that includes some soft-porn?  If it\\'s trying to be legitimate horror, then consider the following:  Many of us have likely witnessed finer, acting performances at a local, high school play...  in fact it may be an insult to high schools all over America to compare the two.  Additionally, you\\'ve probably seen better quality costumes and wigs on display at informal Halloween parties over the years; and if said party had generic, scary music playing in the background then it was decidedly preferable to the scoring for this flick.  Furthermore if you\\'ve ever been completely engrossed in your work at any time and someone innocently walked up from behind and tapped you on the shoulder, thus scaring you, said encounter would represent a substantially greater fear factor than this movie possesses, whereas If you remember playing video games in the 90\\'s and were enthralled by the cut-scenes then you will have witnessed infinitely better CGI.  And finally, if you\\'ve ever been privy to a sixth-grade book report on Bram Stoker\\'s Dracula then you would inevitably find a more professional script than can be found in this film.I felt really bad for Rutger Hauer (Van Helsing) who seems like he accidentally wandered onto the set from the local rest home, Thomsas Kretschmann (Dracula... no I mean he\\'s Dracula) does a really lousy Gary Oldman impersonation and Asia Argento (the chick on the cover) is just straight-up embarrassing to watch.  In all fairness, I have seen worse horror films (\"Plan 9 From Outer Space\" & \"Manos, Hands of Fate\" come to mind) however I absolutely would not recommend spending actual money on watching this cheese-festival (lucky for me it was on Netflix) cuz it sucks really, really bad.  :o)', 'This show has really gone down hill fast. The storyline is getting ridiculous and convoluted. This is not the type of series that lends itself to long seasonal and mid-seasonal breaks because people forget what is going on and give up trying to follow it.  I am guessing that this will be the final season - at least it will be for me.', \"You have to be an expert on Versace and his life to get where this movie starts and goes.  It is lame excerpt for Gina Gershon's portrayal of Donatella she does a superrb job otherwise this thing is unwatchable even for a Lifetime movie.\", \"I suppose this intends to be a celebration of the art of design.  I found it awful in every sense.  The ego dripping off of 'the star' revolted me. Even though I am anything but sympathetic to the elite class who get to parade around in the fashion world, I can usually find some way to relate because there is genuine art involved in the best fashion.  Do not waste a minute of your time on this narcissistic drivel.\", \"I can't believe how gullible people are! Do you really believe Theresa &#34;talks to dead people&#34;? Read up on the tricks of mediums. Number one is always that they ask a leading question and they only address people in questions, forcing the person to divulge information. (Watch for this next time?: &#34;Did someone here lose a parent recently?&#34; If she's talking to middle-aged folks, of course they're likely to have lost a parent by that age.  &#34;I see blood. Was there a tragic accident?&#34; Well, duh!)Also, don't you think the backgrounds of the people who appear on this show are fully investigated before an episode is filmed? Of course they are! Everything is prepared for. A production company doesn't just show up with seven people and start filming randomly. There's a story behind each dead person and of course that's been researched before Theresa even appears on the scene. And, believe it or not, she is briefed.For instance, I was watching the show in which Theresa is woken in the night and &#34;spoken to&#34; by a little girl in a hotel. In the morning, at checkout, Theresa mentions it to the desk attendant and Theresa seems blown away when the clerk tells her of a girl who died in the hotel many years ago.  I said to my son, &#34;I'd bet $1,000 that the death of that girl is well known in that area.&#34; One simple Google search later and sure enough, the hotel is thought to be haunted by the girl's ghost.And have you noticed what the &#34;dead person&#34;/Theresa says is exactly what the living want to hear?: &#34;Your father says he forgives you.&#34; &#34;Your husband says to go on with your life.&#34; &#34;Your mother tells you she is finally at peace.&#34; Come on now!!! Why is it never, &#34;Your father still blames you for his death&#34; or &#34;Your mother thinks that you should leave your husband because he's no good.&#34; If Theresa, oh, sorry, the dead people, were to tell the living they are still suffering on the other side or still hold someone to blame or whatever, Theresa would be out of business. And what a business she has!If you people believe this stuff is random, I've got some oceanfront property in Death Valley I'd like to sell you. Theresa's pretty convincing, I have to say that. Not everyone could pull off such a stunt, but--news flash--it's all hooey.\", \"I don't know what &#34;Juliette&#34; did to be cast in that role, but she's an awful actress. After watching all the seasons so far, I've come to the conclusion that her best acting is done when she's pretending to be in a coma. Aside from that, she manages little more than a furrowed brow and slightly widened eyes even when she should be acting terribly upset. She's also just had too much cosmetic surgery. The nose job is too pinched, the cheek implants don't fit her face, the dye job on her hair is too burgundy, and the botoxed upper lip fails to look attractive in any way. She sort of reminds me of the Bride of Frankenstein -- just too many parts put together to make an unattractive whole. I feel bad for the woman but she's just not an actress. She should go into some line of work where she can do well instead of trying to act.\", \"While it's true the show is about monsters and the ensuing violence this season was too over the top with dismemberment, gutting, and basically all around desecrating a corpse for a ritual. It taints the show and makes me really not want to watch it anymore.\", \"It's a struggle to watch this season of Grimm. I had my doubts towards the end of season 2, and now it's just stupid.

Just goes to show that anyone with $500 for an HD camera can produce a waste of time video. No humor unless, again high school crude was the high light of your education; no story other than three weeks (boringly noted with day 1. day 2, etc. superimposed) of a few people in a house just drinking, talking and acting stupid.

This role I did not like and the story line was not unique enough given all the other vampire movies out lately to be worth seeing the whole movie through.

The trailers looked enticing, and Jonathan Rhys-Myers does a very convincing American accent.Instead of being satisfied with the blood, I was confused, and felt like Lestat when he drinks the blood of two dead boys in Interview With The Vampire. The plot bears hardly any resemblance to the novel, and it's more like a sexed-up, stripped-down version of the novel. And while the 1931, 1979 & 1958 versions aren't exactly close to the book either, they're at least more watchable than this tired mess of rotting flesh. The definitive Dracula film, in my opinion, is Bram Stoker's Dracula, directed by Francis Ford Coppola (the Godfather trilogy) and starring Gary Oldman, Winona Ryder, Academy Award winner Sir Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves, Cary Elwes, Sadie Frost, Monica Belluci, Richard E.

The Wales country home is unkept with unwashed dishes piled high as a small girl, middle teen brother and older teen brother (who seems to be able to talk to animals) run the place. Their mom, who is suppose to be highly educated, appears to be jetting off to Europe to discuss peace concerning some unknown adversaries all the while leaving the kids unattended.3.

The Red Planet alone is not enough to carry a movie.The best example possible is \"Last Days on Mars,\" which has no plot or concept beyond \"there are zombies... ON MARS!\" I can\\'t imagine that anyone involved put any more thought into this movie than \"zombies... ON MARS!\", because there is literally nothing else to it. It\\'s a mediocre, unscary zombie story transplanted into a shallow copy of \"Alien.\"And while it stars two actors that I adore, their good performances couldn\\'t save this wretched pile of festering fetid celluloid -- it has no plot, no real climax, a third act that drags on forever, and characters with the depth of a shopping list.Mankind has landed on Mars, and now scientists have gone there to do... stuff. Their goals are never really explained. Then a team finds a mysterious bacterium growing on Mars, but before they can study it further, one of the astronauts falls into a sinkhole and dies. Then he comes back as a desiccated mummy, and immediately power-drills one one of his crewmates... and no, that is NOT a euphemism.Yes, the mysterious bacteria turns people -- living or dead -- into zombies, and it takes almost nothing to infect people. The astronauts frantically try to stop the zombies who (for some reason) are desperate to kill them, and must find a way off Mars before all of them are infected. And since this is trying to be \"Alien\" with zombies, they want to keep it from reaching Earth.It is honestly difficult to summarize this turd. Here\\'s how I imagine the conception of this movie went: two inept Hollywood producers were sitting together, having a conversation.\"Hey, I\\'ve got this idea. It\\'s zombies...\"\"Totally overdone.\"\"... ON MARS.\"\"Genius! It technically hasn\\'t been done before! We\\'re greenlighting it!\"That is the entire plot. No twists. No unexpected discoveries. No suspense about how they will stop the bacterium.

Even worse, the ending drags on forever. The final half-hour is the longest third act I\\'ve ever seen in a movie -- just a slow, climax-free drag that finally putters out when Robinson runs out of things to do.It also has characters just deep enough to give you paper cuts. There\\'s a halfhearted attempt to give Liev Schreiber\\'s character a tragic past, by hinting at a disaster that has made him claustrophobic (for some reason). But the disaster is never expounded on, and it\\'s just sort of dropped halfway through the movie. The rest of the characters can be summed up in one or two words -- Abrasive, Leader, Perky, Coward, et cetera.And honestly, the actors deserved better. Liev Schreiber gives a sort of halfhearted but serviceable performance; Romola Garai seems to be pouring her heart into a thanklessly shallow role, but she does give the movie its only moment of real pathos. There are other good actors here -- Goran Kosti&#263;, Elias Koteas -- but they\\'re pretty much cannon fodder. Tossing out a mention of a character having kids does not make them three-dimensional.\"Last Days on Mars\" is just another dumb, inept zombie movie, and setting it on the maligned Red Planet doesn\\'t really improve matters.

I took this film because there was a time where I just could not get enough of IFC films.  This movie although everyone seems to hate the plot?  I think the plot was okay. It is not cut and dry that a lesbian turns into a zombie after a one night stand. What bothered me was I thought the plot was okay. Not great but worth a watch. Then The actress who plays the lead (Sam) is fantastic.  You will see her in future films trust me.  But once you know what is wrong with her, and you know early on, the movie leads you nowhere. The whole movie is about watching her decay?  That is it.  I wont give the ending away.  I will just say I don't think there was an ending.  It started out with an idea, but never went forward, and then completely just went flat.  There were events that made no sense, and had nothing to do with the story. They took a good idea, and turned it into a B movie.  What a shame.  I think you will be very unhappy if you watch it. I wont say don't watch it, because everyone should make up their own mind. This was really a bad movie. I would not have watched it for free if i had the chance if i knew what it was before hand.  The only thing good was the  main character. Meaning her as an actress.  She goes to a party, she is in love with a girl who wants her space. She has sex with a guy you don't see.  And then she looks to be pregnant and then gets really sick which people are calling her a zombie.  I don't know what she is or what the point was?  And when you see the end?  I think you will be highly upset.  Oh, and she sees the doctor two times, and not once does she get sent to a hospital. Ask yourself if you watch this, if you saw this girl looking like this, would you not send her to the hospital?  It was just poor writing, and the movie went nowhere.

She hardly ever gets it right, and how could she with this &#34;line-up and act and dress like something you are not&#34; approach. It is all so surface. She coaches them on how to be what the millionaire wants. Not good. And it all happens so badly.Here is the right show. Take the Million Dollar Listing show and have several matchmakers trying to &#34;sell&#34; a client. See multiple dates (just like you see all these property showings).

I can\\'t decide what kind of disorder this woman has, besides extreme narcissism, but something is very wrong. My best guess is that she got bullied in school, never asked to the dance-and now thinks it\\'s her turn, as an adult, to hurt the moms she belittles out of envy-she has no husband and kids to go home to, no gal pals she doesn\\'t have to terrorize/bribe into hanging out with, no little black dresses to work enough magic on her with. I\\'m not trying to be mean-nobody has it all. Just, why hate on innocent kids of moms she is jealous of or just plain mad at? It\\'s beyond pathetic or unprofessional - it\\'s sick. You just don\\'t treat people this way-especially little kids.Interesting that Abby called Payton out -who surely was a big bully-so early on, while being literally the biggest meanest bully ever! Who can forget her bawling openly-instead of \"saving her tears for her pillow\" as she so cruelly yelled at virtually every child there to do at various times-when Maddie  *gasp* screwed up, then screaming, when called out on it \"oh well, some kids are just special!\" No, Abby, ALL of those kids are special, and if you weren\\'t so focused on one kid, you couldn\\'t help but see that!  Then, on this latest episode we hear Maddie turn from what once seemed like a nice person into a little snot-her response to a TEAMMATE\\'s being legitimately upset over something that would have thrown HER (the sorest loser on the team) into \"the vapours\" was to cynically spit out \" it\\'s two minutes in life-she just needs to get over it.\" No matter how often she wins, that is behavior of a loser. Neither Melissa nor Abby are doing her any favors. She is going to grow up thinking she\\'s just a little bit better than the rest of us. Life has a way of sending us lessons about ego and such, when we need them. And not so many friends. Maddie is in for a rough time when those lessons start coming and she sees what divatude attracts-and doesn\\'t.  She is a child-at this point she still has that time/excuse-but, unfortunately, a few key very poor role models.Just imagine what the otherlifers-Brooke, Paige, Nia, and Chloe -could be and do with equal love and attention? They are absolutely wonderful despite the bullying and the uneven playing field-while managing to be nice little girls who don\\'t think they are better or make snarky comments-I just wish they could manage to not OWN Abby\\'s words quite so much. Living well is the best revenge, and they all have the talent to draw themselves up and show Abby out of spite if nothing else-Chloe has beaten the favorite before, and I\\'d love to see Maddie up against any of the others in Hip Hop, Paige especially. Ironically,,they are the product Miss Abby created, and they deserve and could be so much more. It was egregious to pit the two duets -TEAMMATES-against one another, and if the blondes had had the confidence they should have , they could have come out on top, particularly if they had gotten the encouragement and rehearsal time the Teammate/competitors (who DOES that?) had been given. Seriously, not only is there more than one good dancer on the TEAM, for Abby to think that she had only produced one and that she genuinely needs a traveling side show to find other schools\\' talent to poach to build a winning team really is selling herself a bit short. She has had winning TEAMS -including THIS one- for years. To pimp herself out as dance \\'s version of Simon Cowell for a bit more fame/attention...kind of speaks for itself, at that. Is she all about Going Hollywood or is she in the legitimate business of molding talented professional career-driven dancers for the sake of the art that she poses as?I do know that if this is real, I wouldn\\'t subject my child to either end of the Dance Dementia spectrum-and I think being the pet would be the most damaging position of all, long term.Kendall is not a lifer, to her benefit-but she is developing the same pained \"I just sat on the point of the top of the pyramid\" expression on her face while she dances that The Favorite always has. The fact that her mom has a habit of repeatedly lapsing into \"I\" or \"we\" as in \"I should have had that solo\" or \"we shouldn\\'t be last on the pyramid\" is both telling and disturbing. Even her kid tells her to knock it off.. I\\'m always thinking of Nia, Paige, Brooke, and Chloe, who have been there languishing in obscurity since toddler-hood every time Jill starts with what \"we\" deserve. Does the woman ever listen to herself?Ironically, Abby seems to be biting out of the same rotten Ohio Apple as her smarmy competitor -ignoring an opportunity to turn confidence, energy and deserved equal attention from the products of a lifelong devotion to her studio, despite the abuse, favortism, and neglect they\\'re repeatedly subjected to-instead, poaching from the fruits of competition studios\\' labor. As several savvy moms have repeatedly pointed out, is the irony of this completely lost on her? She has greater confidence in the products of other studios than in her own? What\\'s next, strutting around wearing molting rat fur vests,  looking like a multi-colored rat is loose on her head, calling everyone else\\'s \"fashion\" tacky while Applepolishing purchased talent \"guest choreographers\", recruiting from utube and thinly-veiled publicity sucking \"twittercalls\" -oh wait, she\\'s already doing most of that! Why not try being creative, developing from within her ranks to give the same attention, choreography, costumes, private lessons, interest and encouragement to all that she pours into the only one who truly reflects the results of her lifelong tutelage that she has deemed worthy? Let\\'s see THEN what happens. I think, frankly, she\\'s selling herself way too short, and I wish it was just her problem.This show used to be fun. Now, if it is real, it really crosses the line into abuse and, in either case, it stopped being fun to watch long ago. She is no longer a professional, she is out of control, mean, abusive, and needs to get over the whole big mouth big hair big fingernails and big ego, etc.-a caricature every plus-sized drag queen parade has undoubtedly added to their routine.But that\\'s her problem. Unfortunately, I fear that all of these kids will need therapy. Abby needs to get first in line, and today\\'s favoriteright behind her.She knows less about real class than Cathy Apple does, and that\\'s saying something.', 'If you enjoy watching children being abused by an emotionally stunted ego-maniacal bitch ... then this is your show.I\\'m ashamed to admit I watched Dance Moms for years.  I loved seeing the children dance, so I\\'d fast forward the seemingly staged Mama-drama and clips of Abby shouting herself into chronic laryngitis.  Last year it slowly dawned on me that these people aren\\'t faking.Many of the adults on this show are emotional train wrecks.  Abby really is a pretentiously self serving fowl mouthed (yeah I know she says she doesn\\'t use bad words) bitch, who doesn\\'t give a $***about anyone\\'s feelings but her own.  She\\'s also a child abuser in the WORST way.  What kind of wacked out idiot would label a child \"road kill\" on national TV?!  Why would ANYONE constantly reduce children to tears on national TV?!  That these kid\\'s parents pay Abby to constantly hurt their children makes them just as bad.As an adult survivor of child abuse, I know how much damage words can cause.  That this show is allowed to continue, and these children remain fodder for abuse by Abby, wanna be dance teachers, supposedly well meaning Dance Moms, wanna be Dance Moms with wanna be children dancers ... turns my stomach.Mark my words, these kids are growing up with issues ... HUGE issues.  The fact that Child Protective Services hasn\\'t been called in to investigate Ms Abby\\'s disgusting behavior is disgraceful!The ultimate irony is the fact that Ms Abby was in bankruptcy when this horrid show started.  Shame on the producers, shame on Abby, shame on the parents and shame on us for allowing this horrid show to thrive.', \"Un-watchable.  Despicable.  Shameless.  Disgusting.  If you enjoy car accidents, you might enjoy this show.  The children are brainwashed, overworked, and abused.  The parents are desperate for money or fame or a vicarious life by exploiting their children.  The people involved in the coordination and production of these talent shows, etc. are sad, creepy individuals.I guess some kids will always suffer at the hands of their parents.  This show is a sad, vomit-inducing example of sick domineering adults ruining children's lives.  Here we watch a sampling of superficial, unkind, psychologically-lost Americans.I guess there is some form of entertainment in that.  Just don't support these maniacs financially by buying the show.  If you HAVE to see this tripe, find it on cable.\", 'Giving a reason why this movie is all kinds of awfulness would be a disservice to anyone reading this review because quite simply I had to shut it off after 20 minutes. It was that bad.', \"Warning: spoilers.  Young women are kidnapped and forced to fight each other to the death for the entertainment of others.  You've very likely seen this story done before--but never with the ill-advised seriousness on display here.  Raze is filmed and scored with all the lightness and humor of a holocaust film--which pretty much drains every ounce of entertainment value from the pulpy material.The movie makes a fatal mistake almost immediately: At the start it appears that actress Rachel Nichols will be the lead, but the filmmakers pull a bait and switch--she is killed in the first fight and Zoe Bell becomes the lead character.  The problem?  While Bell, who was Uma Thurman's stunt double on the Kill Bill films, acquits herself about as well as you would expect during the fight sequences the more emotional scenes are far beyond her abilities, making it impossible to care one way or another what happens to her.  The filmmakers would have been much better off using Rachel Nichols as the lead and Zoe Bell as the villain--that way she could still do her thing in the fight scenes without killing the rest of the movie.The fight scenes are brutal but they become repetitive and dull very quickly.The only entertainment value in the entire movie is oddball character actor Doug Jones, who plays the L Ron Hubbard like cult leader who is behind the fights.  During the film's one and only truly effective scene a number of the woman are strapped down to school desks while he explains the higher purpose behind what they are doing.  Unfortunately, Jones isn't given much to play with beyond that one scene.Raze will undoubtedly appeal to people who like to see women beat the crap out of each other and require nothing more.  Everyone else is strongly advised to give Raze a pass.\", 'For those under the influence of sleep deprivation or LSD, Peyote, Magic Mushrooms or other hallucinogenics this would be an ideal watch!

The idea is to make fun of the tropes and melodrama of the epic, best selling, historical romances that proliferated during the period. All of the familiar elements are present: the wealthy but troubled family with secrets, their home, sometimes with hints of the gothic that represents a character in itself, unrequited love, revenge, death, business and wealth.In the real world, there is the mineable territory of Hollywood with its excesses and egotistical stars, directors and writers. S of B takes them all on, making fun of the mini-series and novels that it lampoons. Conclusion? These books and the productions based on them were melodrama that took themselves far too seriously and had quality issues of writing, directing, acting and production. That's it. That's the joke....full stop.I could get on board if I was getting a decent story and characters supporting the joke, but we don't because to give good story and characters the production team would have to resort to the techniques and tropes of  the genre they're satirizing and they can't do that because that would cut the legs from under their one joke pony.

Did the POV characters somehow spend more than 24hrs in the elevator and parking garage and not notice the passage of that much time?  Oh, and a UH-60 just flies up and crashes into an LAPD chopper.  That deserves at least a little explanation.  Do the producers realize that apocalypse thing has been done to death?  Apparently not.\", \"All I have to say is &#34;Why&#34; Amazon.  You take something really good & have good potential of becoming the first show to take over &#34;Dead man Walk&#34; and turn it to a trash.  I really wish they didn't put the nude scenes.  I understand it is not a regular TV, but still I would've liked to be more realistic than someone is scared to death find the time to enjoy a swim naked.\", \"This is sad.  It's all so hackneyed.  It's like Chris Carter took the lamest and most cliched aspects of every recent dystopian/Armageddon story, poorly dramatized them, and then picked the most stereotypical and most unsympathetic characters, and made a tasteless bento box out of it.\", 'Can I have my hour back please?I really hate twists at the end of shows and movies that have very little to do with the show or movie I just watched, but I imagine it MUST be hard to fasten on a twist ending when the entire plot is a slimy eel wriggling in your grasp. That\\'s simile.I\\'m not sure what was going on, and I don\\'t guess that this show knew, either. I think the writers were watching \"The Walking Dead\" and thought aloud:\"Let\\'s make a show about OUR OWN apocalypse!\"\"But, hey,\" another writer said, \"zombies are SO last week.\"\"Vampires have been done to DEATH,\" injected Jamie Kennedy, coughing and stuffing his face with cheese puffs. \"What HASN\"T been done in a while...or EVER (successfully)?\" They all shrugged their shoulders in a non-committal fashion and started hacking out the script for \"THE AFTER\".Putting aside the bong, they busted out the 20 sided die* they had from their Dungeons and Dragons game and made an alphabetic list of things that could cause an apocalypse that might be remotely entertaining, beginning with Aliens, and ending in Zombie-hybrids (leaving out E for \"Ear Mites\", I for \"Indiana Jones Impersonators\", L for \"Leprechauns\", P for \"Preying Mantis\", R for \"Rascally Rabbits\", and W for \"Wascally Wabbits\", much worse than the former).The only saving grace with the characters is that they were so fresh and original, no cobwebs to dust off these babies! A black prisoner innocently convicted, a white lawyer who\\'s secretly corrupt, a vaguely hispanic female cop with everything to prove, a gay guy with a wacky day job, a slutty blond from someplace South-ish, a rich jewish lady with a spanish housekeeper, and... this will shatter your religion... an IRISHMAN who drinks WAY too much! It\\'s preposterous! Am I forgetting someone...? Oh, yeah, the security douche bag. I think there was a protagonist too here somewhere, but tacked on in a slap-dash manner and thinly portrayed. Not worth further examination.That\\'s called sarcasm.The featured characters are what Thomas Harris\\'s Hannibal Lecter called \"Desperately Random\", which means NOT RANDOM AT ALL, but wishing to SEEM so. In THE AFTER\\'s sense, it means that the characters are so oddly varied and/or paradoxically foiled against one another that it makes one wonder if they used that same 20 sided die to determine what half of the characters would be from the list: \"Harry\\'s Hackneyed Stereotypes to Avoid at All Costs!\", and the other half just trying to make some allegorical diatribe about how things should be in a perfect world we don\\'t have (boo-freaking-hoo!). Every time the convict talked about black folk in jail I wanted to slap him.Foil: innocent black man sent to prison for a murder he didn\\'t commit vs. slick, white lawyer breaking the law by soliciting a hooker in a public stairway.Foil: same innocent black man with the \"CAN DO!\" attitude vs. the passive-aggressive white-spanish cop seeking to put him away, but ultimately, and utterly, ineffectual in any real sense. She was the ONLY authority figure in the ambulance and just caved like a jellyfish to the whim of the very guy she was sworn to capture. She would happily put away that innocent black man, but he\\'s too busy delivering CANDY CANES and WHOOP-BUTT to protect the group, and he\\'s FRESH OUT OF CANDY CANES, baby!I think the events that not even the police or the crowds stumbling around oblivious even realized was going on (...Wait, WHAT?!?!?!..) was that someone farted on set, and it was just really, really bad, so they had hours and hours of footage trying to figure out who farted. Seriously. Watch the parts of the show where people are just wandering vaguely here and there, scared of nothing in particular, but refusing to go back to their ordinary lives, and just imagine someone off camera letting one rip. You will suddenly understand method acting.At one point, all the people are racing around with luggage like they all remembered they had planned a trip to Majorca that afternoon and they\\'re all going to miss their flight.Keep in mind, all this time there is NO ACTUAL APOCALYPSE going on. There are NO ZOMBIES, or anything else ATTACKING ANYONE, NOTHING is BLOWING UP, STARTING on FIRE, SHOOTING PEOPLE or BEING SHOT at BY people, and yet the mob of pedestrians decide to attack the group as if the \"heroes\" were Bogarting the latest iPhone design! It would be like you hearing a boom, losing power in your work, going outside, and then losing your mind with no conception of why you were there, blundering about for 45 clueless minutes and THAT\\'S when you see a group of folk in an ambulance and you just have to tear them apart with your bare hands for no particular reason! Why in the heck doesn\\'t anyone just go home or back to work?Perhaps that\\'s the reason why there\\'s the non-apocalypse and suddenly a group that has no reason at all for hanging out together suddenly go all Scooby Doo Mystery Solvers Club despite their vast differences--or their secret sameness-ess-ess...? I don\\'t even think the actors knew that the big-screen quality of the first 95 POINTLESS percent of the movie was going to sprint right into a cheesy \"B\" production right at the end. That\\'s the REAL twist. Surprise! There\\'s NO MORE MONEY LEFT to shoot this show. We blew it renting a wedding mansion, the 200,000 stand-ins, and these cameras. Good thing we didn\\'t RENT the cameras, or they\\'d be going back, too.They really believed that if they just gave the group enough momentum that their pace alone would mop up any plot leaks, but it actually WAS the plot (or plot-synthetic) sprinkled all-too-liberally with brief, shambling pauses for character development. There\\'s NO TIME TO EXPLAIN! Get out of the elevator! Now, let\\'s talk about our feelings. Get out of the parking garage! Now, let\\'s talk about our feelings. Get out of the street! Let\\'s hear about those feelings. Get back to your hotel room! Now, let\\'s hash out our feelings. Get in the ambulance! Quick, feelings? Bust into the mansion! Consensus... feelings? Sprint into the forest! Let\\'s see how we\\'re feeling. Get fondled by a naked, tattooed contortionist in grey henna! Feelings anyone? Get in your time machine and warn yourself not to watch this show... awe, dang. Can\\'t do that last one. Show\\'s over. Maybe time travel will be in the next episode. I have a... feeling that it might (could be F&%$#&G; anything, really).*Spoiler - They landed on D for \"Demons from the Netherworld\", and guess what? Each character has the same birthday. Hmm. Not sure that matters in the history of ever. Oh, but they each have a tattoo-like birth mark that together make some sick artwork on the back of the demon that stalks them for the last two minutes of the show so that it can give them shoulder massages in the forest. So, the fact that the SCG (Stereotypical Character Gang) are all suddenly so chummy and comfortable around each other is because they are all secretly connected despite having been introduced in an entirely (muffled snickering) random way. I\\'m blowing your mind now. Sorry. (SHHH.. its not random at all... keep it a secret...)I cannot even imagine what randomly (hehe) generated cinematic gold we will stagger into aimlessly in the next episode! If anyone in the next episode says anything to the kin of \"You guys are my family, now!\" I\\'m going to have to wash my eyes out with soap.', \"Stereotypical characters, marginal performances, someone trying to get in on the whole &#34;under the dome&#34; craze.And they're running sirens through the whole damn episode, I started to get a headache after awhile.World is in turmoil, I get it, thumpy music is nice for accents on the plot, but drive that music through the whole show and sirens at top volume and oh yeah, that's fun to listen to (sarcasm)Hoped to get a winner from these pilots, so far, no good.\", \"When the main character says &#34;I just want this to end&#34;,  boy did I agree with her.  Since she is french, I'll try to say it in french:  Qu'est ce qu'on charge de merde!Everything about this was awful.  From the idea to the writing to the acting.  This is an unoriginal, uninspired cross between the Walking Dead and the show where Ichabod Crane is in 21st C New England.  it also cleaves to convention heavily; the pilot plot was quite predictable.  Oh, wait:  was that seriously Peter Sarsgaard in there for a minute?  It is shocking to see an actor of his caliber in this tripe.  THAT was unpredictable.  Honestly, this wouldn't make it ten episodes on network TV.  And that french chick is so annoying I found it difficult to make it through even one episode.  Her acting is worse than my french.  Everyone involved should be ashamed of themselves.\", \"Sorry, I couldn't get pass the first 5mins when the bad 'french' actress was trying to practice her audition---just horrible. Sorry, but I have to be hooked the first 5mins---like I was with 'BreakingBad', 'Dexter', 'House of Cards'------you can't start with mediocrity.....most people don't have time to sit through pretense.  For this kind of genre; I'd rather stick to watching the old school original stuff like the X-Files---much more interesting.....\", \"At first I was intrigued. Strangers trapped in a locked parking lot, no electricity, isolated from the rest of the city.  Then they got out and the storyline was downhill after that.The acting got worse. I'm no prude but the consistent use of the F word was both annoying and unnecessary. I wanted to stop watching  but I suffered through, hoping it might get better. And the ending was just stupid - no lead up to the last &#34;character,&#34;Bottom line is Chris Carter seems to be playing the same note and without Fox and Dana that note is not sounding good at all.\", 'This pilot is painful to watch! None of  characters in this pilot are likable and the acting is terrible. If you have any chores to do I would recommend doing them instead of watching this, it would be time better well spent.', \"This could easily be one of those lampoons done by the Scary Movie franchise  My favorite scene was the female officer hanging on to back of the getaway ambulance.  What was she doing back there?  She was spread eagled on the back bumper with hardly a hand hold.  Was this supposed to be a dramatic act of heroics?  It looked like the rest of the group wouldn't let her ride inside because she was a minority.  Never-the-less, she seemed grateful to be allowed to ride on the back bumper and helplessly hang on for dear life as the ambulance sped through the city.Eventually, they make it out of the city after being chased by an angry mob and find refuge in the old lady's mansion, whereupon it only seems appropriate that the sexy babe character would strip entirely naked and go swimming  in the pool, because you see, they are all in the middle of an obvious crisis situation, and that's what would happen in the Scary Movie franchise.\", \"I am SHOCKED that this show has such high ratings.  I'm a fan of sci-fi and will generally give sci-fi shows plenty of lattitude.However, this is one of those shows where the characters are all annoying and annoyingly stupid (minus the black guy who seems to be the only person that has a clue).  Everyone else is so self absorbed, incompetent and oblivious to the situation that I wouldn't have cared if a giant UFO crashed on them and the show ended.  The show almost comes off as a comedy due to the stupidity of the characters and the ridiculous scenes.  Probably one of the worst pilots I've seen in a long time.

The plot has ADD and skips all over, I watched this with some friends and we all went into this with an extremely open mind. There are many other good selections for amazon to pick up and I really hope this is not one of them. Don't be a sheep! actually *watch* the full pilot before you post a review please! we all love chris carter but this junk stinks.

The acting wasn't great, but I feel sorry for the actors because they had a bad script from which to work.

I'm giving up on the Amazon series, because it doesn't look like they've really decided to make them.

Made it about the plot, not looks or skin shots. Gave realistic dialogue and not clich&eacute; characters-every character in that parking garage is unrealistic and unbelievable.  And then (spoiler) the main female gets out and so does the bugged out eyed angry black guy and they are gone for an hour...but come back at the exact same time even though they aren't together?

There is absolutely no one who would think he's credible, especially over Roddy McDowell in NY or music or anywhere else but a loony bin. No one.3) There is a hot female cellist - whose only purpose seems to be to have sex with people or encourage other people to do so. I just don't understand her point. We get it already. This is a sexy show. You don't need someone/her to say it in EVERY scene.4) What a waste of Bernadette Peters.5) I couldn't tell you where this show is going after the pilot, nor do I care. None of the characters seem anything more than a stereotype or some odd cartoon or likable, for that matter.6) Gabriel Garcia is just awful. I suggest a major re-write, re-cast or make sure this character is killed off before you continue. You can probably run over the cellist too - unless you intend to give her more to do than give blow jobs. I hear she's an actress, you might start there...It's too bad. New York is an interesting place. And I haven't met a musician without an interesting story to tell. Did you even attempt to talk to anyone who actually knew anything about New York or musicians? It doesn't seem so.My problem is not the sex. My problem is there is no story, no one to root for, no characters that seem like there was any thought put into them...

Why not just break into the cabinet (or whatever the key fits) directly without having to go through all this elaborate, low probability, highly unpredictable caper. Or, just break into the piano.

The studios are too busy promoting the wide releases of their Oscar hopefuls to concentrate on new films they have any hope for. As a result, January is a dumping ground for bad films they can't wait to write off. But Big Hollywood still hopes they can bilk an unsuspecting public out of a few million dollars before the release ends up in streaming and free cable hell.Because &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is a quote-unquote romantic comedy and it is being released two weeks before Valentine's Day, I held out some hope for it. That, and the fact Zac Efron seems to be enjoying a bit of a renaissance since leaving rehab &#8211; he is in a lot films &#8211; seemed to indicate the film might be better.But &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is full of, well, awkward moments that were funny the first five times we saw the same jokes in other films and television shows. Now, one hundred times later, the jokes are boring and routine. These jokes are now so familiar they have been relegated to bad television sitcoms.Zac Efron and Miles Teller play Jason and Daniel, co-workers and best friends, who meet regularly with Mikey (Michael P. Jordan, &#34;Fruitvale Station&#34;), a doctor who discovers his wife is cheating on him - to discuss girls, dating and their conquests. They talk about every part of their sexual conquests, their penises, their bodily functions, etc. They talk a lot about things I find it hard to believe three straight guys pursuing relationships with females would talk about.Eventually, they make a pact to stay single as long as Mikey is single. Given the predictability of THIS quote-unquote romantic comedy, you already know what that means; one or more of the guys will immediately fall in love with a girl and try to hide it from the others. Strangely, the filmmakers views these relationships as an excuse for the three guys to get together and talk more. The story doesn't really shift to the new male-female relationships. Essentially, this is a quote-unquote romantic comedy about three guys.That might work, if the film were in better creative hands. Written and directed by Tom Gormicon, whose only other credit is &#34;Movie 43&#34; &#8211; the worst film I have ever seen &#8211; nothing in &#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is original or seems remotely real or true. That's too bad because you get the sense the filmmakers are trying for so much more. Which makes &#34;Moment&#34; an even bigger disappointment.And it's too bad for Zac Efron who is a really handsome, really terrible actor &#8211; he has the looks of a matinee idol but he just can't act. When he works with more talented directors, he does a better job. But in &#34;Moment&#34;, his character just seems like a jerk, the whole time, and never really changes.Miles Teller is basically the comic relief and Michael P. Jordan plays the 'real' member of the trio. He is going through a real-life situation. But they don't, or can't, overcome the clich&eacute;d story, bad direction and stilted acting of the lead.Imogen Poots plays Ellie, the object of Jason's affections. She must be the next &#34;It&#34; girl, because she is in a lot of movies coming out this year. She doesn't earn that title with this performance. She is good, OK, acceptable, but because she has to play against Efron, her performance fails to register.&#34;That Awkward Moment&#34; is bad.

Every scene is littered with exposition throughout the script (&#34;You're a prisoner on deathrow and face execution.&#34; / &#34;You were trained at Quantico and now you're working on the Tate case&#34;). Hardly anything is said that isn't trying to explain the derivative back stories to the audience to the point where I'm screaming at the TV every time somebody utters one of these inane lines.The bad guys have a near-telepathic capability of knowing where she is at all times and the good guys do the worst job possible in keeping her out of harm's way, except when they use their own near-telepathic knowledge to protect her. The script conveniently forgets everything that goes before it (hey, there's a bag of money on a  fire escape in New York that's still there) and gives the audience no idea of where it's going beyond &#34;we're going to the safe house&#34; or &#34;we're going to Philadelphia&#34; - why not let's go to Disneyland and at least have some fun? Oh, and then major characters disappear - the laughably bad assassin from the pilot presumably didn't test well with the audience, even though they were the least demanding audience in history for liking the rest of the show.All the drama is developed from a simplistic triangle of good guys, bad guys (Kyle MacLachlan phones it in) and law enforcement all acting like IQs are dropping everywhere. They operate in a complete vacuum of reality so one moves and the others react and three chase sequences later we're at the end of the episode. And there's zero realism to any of the decisions made by the three groups pushing the wafer-thin plot forward so very, very slowly. There hasn't been this much stupidity in a TV show since The Following got renewed but admittedly even that managed to attempt to engage the audience.The acting is wooden, the dialog is stilted, the fight scenes are horribly shot, there no tension, there's no suspension of disbelief and there's no plot. How can it get any worse? Cuaron just won an Oscar but I suspect he's now lending his name like &#34;Steven Spielberg Presents&#34; - take away his and JJ Abrams' writing credits and here you have a show that would otherwise simply never be aired. It's a total train wreck of irredeemably poor writing and production that's reminiscent of the worst days of the Glen A Larson's factory weeklies. Absolute drivel in every respect and I'm embarrassed to say I watched two of these.\", 'Ohmy. I used to think that the brand J.J. Abrams meant something good. Now I guess it means that he is being well paid to put his name behind even beyond bad products. Like this. There is not a single redeeming quality that excuses this disaster. The general plot is so bad, repetitive, and predictable as are the plots of each episode. Having a cute lovely child as main character doesn\\'t do anything to mitigate the fact that the plot, the dialogues, and the acting are just terrible. Renegade group of scientists / good rebels help little paranormally gifted girl to escape from being used by mean scientist and government as a weapon. She is paired with a man wrongfully accused of murder, who is rescued from his own execution (an absolutely unnecessary \"plot twist\" -- faux pas really). This guy is her dad, which you know in about 5 seconds, but he is very very very slow and the only person in the universe for whom it takes a couple of terribly bad episodes to discover the obvious. And even though she controls minds and objects and reads situations and people and changes reality, they are utterly unable of doing anything decently well. Except, of course, being very, but very, really good samaritans (in case the blonde hair illuminated by an unsourced light was too sutil, you might need clues to understand that she is angelical). So, they escape all the time. The little angel and the wrongly persecuted criminal. None of whom should be in the acting career. Let\\'s hope they catch them soon and put an end to our misery.', \"Good guys, bad guys and a little girl who could be used for either.  The good guys do an unbelievably bad job of being good.  The bad guys do an unbelievably bad job of being bad and the little girl is totally confused.  She knows she has some special capabilities but doesn't seem to know why.  OK, she's a little girl, so let that one go for a while.However, both the good guys and the bad guys know that the little girls capabilities could be used as a &#34;weapon&#34;.  Presumably a weapon of mass destruction or something to do with world domination.  Yeah, right, now that's totally believable.From the little bits and pieces thrown in all over the place the following seems to be the story line:  Some rich guy got mixed up in genetic mutation and found he could manipulate people with &#34;special&#34; capabilities.  Some of the people who worked for the rich guy didn't like the direction he was going so they split and became the &#34;good guys&#34;, leaving the rich guy and whoever he had left to be the &#34;bad guys&#34;.  But the plot thickens.  The good guys kidnap (that's a crime) a little girl because they can see that the bad guys are going to use her for no good.  Then they break a convicted criminal out of jail to be the girls &#34;protector&#34;.  And if we believe the sub plot, this crim really is a bad guy.  Even the little girl picks up on it.  The guy looks at her and tears develop.  The girl tells him he's crying because he used to be good once.  That implies that he really is bad now.  But I'm innocent he says. And the &#34;wise&#34; little girl says, that's what everyone in jail claims.  So why have the good guys picked this one particular &#34;bad&#34; guy to be her protector.  Because....wait for it....because he's her father. Wow!!Ok, so it is a very confusing tale (so far at least) but none of that is helped by the twists and turns that simply go unanswered and are all left to our imagination.  Take the female assassin.  Not a very good one as she fails in every attempt.  So she just up and disappears from the scene to be replaced by a male assassin who obviously isn't any better.  Take the scenario at the casino.  The &#34;protector&#34; convinces the girl to use her capabilities to help him win some money (to replace the bag full he left on a fire escape).  So rightly or wrongly, she helps him rip off a craps table to the tune of 30K.  When he notices that the girl is no longer sitting in the eatery, he panics, cashes in his chips and leaves to find the kid.  Now during his sojourn at the craps table, there was a craps table boss.  He had never seen this guy before and so when he ups and leaves, this &#34;table boss&#34; knows nothing about him other than he was a big winner who suddenly cashed in his chips and left.So we break to the &#34;table boss&#34; who sneaks out into the stair well for a quick smoke.  The male assassin follows him out and starts to beat the crap (no pun intended) out of the craps table boss, expecting him to know everything about the big winner, like who he is, where he went and on and on the saga goes, becoming more unbelievable with every word that is spoken and every disjointed scene that is played out.There is one theme in the show (I suspect a story line stolen from another show) where the little girl does something &#34;good&#34; for someone.  In the first episode it was a young doctor who wanted to toss in the towel.  In the second episode it was a young boy who needed really expensive life saving treatment.  If my suspicions are correct, this story line will continue throughout the rest of the series and some where amongst all the confusion that is the show, the girl will find someone to do something good for in each ensuing episode.I find it hard to believe that people like JJ Abrahams and organizations like Bad Robot got involved in something as poorly produced as this.  I just hope they got their money up front, because I don't &#34;believe&#34; it will last.  What a title for a show.  &#34;Believe&#34;.

I'm not easily offended (I'm a fan of &#34;Antichrist&#34; for example).  And the idea of this film sounds great on paper.But it's so pretentious and silly; this is the emperor's new clothes.  It's two things swirled together.  One is unrealistic sexual behavior, that came from a male mind like an intricate pornographic fantasy.  It reminded me of de Sade's scribblings, not in a level of sadism but in the fact that it's masturbatory and personal. Nothing much to do with real sex or real people.This is crossed with silly pretentious conversation.  Which is sophomoric.  The dialogue is so ridiculous that it makes me blush, not the sex scenes.Von Trier's films usually sound like solid artistic concepts, but play out badly as slow ponderous things.

Also, what's with not having a proper ambient soundtrack?  The use of pop tunes is comical.

Try again.', \"Possible spoilers.High concept and no-brain techno-thriller about a young woman using a video chat room as part of a grant-funded project who becomes the target of a high-tech psychopath.  Unfortunately every ounce of thought that was put into this movie went into the visual design (Let's shoot a movie where all the footage is on web cams and computer screens--cool!) and none apparently went into the threadbare and consistently illogical script.The problems start almost immediately when our heroine pitches her project to the university board.  Her pitch is basically I'm going to use a video chat for three months and find out about people and stuff.  Despite the lack of any apparent scientific purpose to her project it's approved--and then things rapidly get more idiotic.The Den is one of those video chat sites where you can switch from person to person randomly, pressing next if you don't like what you see.  The filmmakers didn't give any thought to what you might actually see on such a chat site--what they come up with is and old, overweight woman with too much make-up filming herself laughing like she's a character in a David Lynch movie; a group of people who prank unwitting viewers by playing a fake game of Russian roulette; some guy with a cute dancing penis puppet; etc.  While this is all stuff that would not be out of place on You Tube as filmed video if this were being performed live in a rapid screen chat environment then basically you would have people performing the same bit of performance art over and over and over every 30 seconds or so, which is about as believable as anything else in this train-wreck.The heroine is supposedly tech savvy, yet it's obvious very early in the movie that her laptop has been hacked and she does absolutely nothing about it.  It's not like she has no options--she could ask her techi  pal who set up the video recording software on her computer to take a look or she could just ditch the infected laptop and use some of her grant money for a new computer.  Even after she tells her project adviser from the university that her computer has been hacked she still continues to use it and does nothing to protect herself.Later her boyfriend disappears and she's sure it's related to whomever is stalking her via the internet.  This is such a basic idea that you would think there's no way the filmmakers could screw it up but they do.  You see not only did the boyfriend disappear but every scrap of furniture in his apartment disappeared as well, leaving nothing behind but a laptop which is on the floor transmitting to the villain (or villains).  When someone who has a job and a girlfriend disappears for a day or two without warning they don't take their furniture with them--it would have been much less suspicious (not to mention a lot less work) if the villain (or villains) had grabbed the b.f. without also cleaning out his apartment.  Luckily for the villain (but unfortunate for the heroine as well as common sense) the police don't find the situation suspicious at all and tell her to stop wasting their time.The Den actually continues to get worse after that until it finally runs out of even bad ideas and pretty much just turns into an amazingly dumb and gore free knock-off of Hostel if it were directed by Uwe Boll in first-person video game mode.Not recommended unless you are determined to see every single horror movie that comes out this year.\", 'THIS MOVIS IS SO LAME!...IT HAS NO SCRIPT OR PLOT JUST A VAUGE CONCEPT,.

First, it is well-known that only ten percent of murders are solved, so this show give a false sense that perpetrators will ALWAYS be caught (and that's the way cop shops want the public to think i.e. they are doing their jobs!). But what finally bothered me was that ALL the murderers portrayed were white males! Statistically, all four races murder equally, other than blacks, who are more prolific depending on what town and state you're in! (Look it up!) In addition, females murder at HIGHER percentage than males (~52%), so murderers are NOT gender-specific! So what does this mean? If you show ONLY white males murdering and they are murdering mostly women (already shown to be biased), then the assumption is that ONLY white males murder and this sets up a 'fear-base' among populations and biases 'white males'. This is called misinformation i.e. some parts are true and some not and is a form of propaganda. This show is produced by the J*wish New World Order, which has often proved a vendetta against this particular racial group (white males).

This may be rare, but I buy/watch movies based on the actors/actresses rather than the plot.  Obviously, it's hit or miss since not all can be blockbusters.  This one was definitely a miss.  As some posters have already mentioned, there is very little dialogue, a whole lot of SJ looking blankly into space, heavy Scottish accents, and unfortunately a lot of nude men scenes.  The only consolation was that SJ displayed herself in all her glory in a few scenes.  I understand that the female alien role, that SJ played, had a self awareness awakening towards the end, but the journey getting there was excruciating and the ending landed with a dull thud.I must add that the Scottish landscapes and other scenes of life in the UK were spot on.

It asked thought provoking questions about the relationship between men and women, women and women, and humans and animals and it even included questions for discussion at the end. Everything that was intriguing or thought provoking in the book is missing. What replaces it is are shots of Scarlett Johansson staring into space, with and without clothes. Seriously, that is a major part of the film. This film goes beyond slow to tedious. The only thing that kept me watching was the hope that the story I'd read would suddenly burst forth...it never happened. You might as well turn off the volume and treat it as an abstract art film.Perhaps the biggest initial turn-off was the choice of Johansson. In the book, Isserley was not a beautiful woman, having been (painfully) engineered to feature the large breasts that would cause men to leer at a plain girl with the thick glasses she required to see on earth. That fact made the culling of the hunky men she chose much more palatable. They were to a large extent the victim of their intentions to use someone. The objectification of women was a large part of the story. Isserley was also constantly reflecting on her environment. Her alien insights were intriguing, something not captured by the dull stares they were replaced with in the film.In the end, what takes the place of depth and story line is a very slow and repetitive movie interspersed with a bit of fancy CGI. A group of alien men on motorcycles occasionally zip around to clean up any details left behind by her abductions but that is as action oriented as it gets.

The movie aspires to be as literate and artistic as the novel but only manages a silly pretentiousness. The film starts out with 5 minutes of utter darkness followed by a bright light shown directly in the viewers eye that slowly resolves itself into a headlight; yep, somebody just graduated from film school. Get used to that blackness by the way; 80% of the movie is filmed in a shadowy darkness so that the actors are barely visible. It is the worst cinematography I have ever seen in a film that features an A-List Hollywood star (look at the shadowy image of Johansson's face on the box cover: that's exactly what the movie looks like). I know ScarJo relocated to France to be with her new husband, a bonanza for European film makers, but if she keeps making these cheaply produced European films, she won't be an A-List actor for much longer.The plot is pretty straightforward and can be reduced to a single sentence: an alien is surgically reconstructed to appear to be an alluring human female who entices men to the aliens' feeding pens. But you will NEVER figure this out by watching the movie. There is almost no dialogue (a crime when one considers the literacy of the source material), and then it is spoken in an impenetrable Scottish brogue so thick you will need to read captions if you want to know what they are saying.If you are a fan of Michael Fabers' novels, do not watch this movie; his writing is like a swift flowing stream that captures you and carries you along, but this movie is the dam on that stream.\", 'Much of the current cast is unlikable: the two new ones are 1) crazy, and 2) bland; and I would like to see the pretentious and over-bearing Heather booted as well; her arrogance and sense of entitlement has become incredibly annoying.

Because these actors know that they are participating in a fraud, a money-making venture that is exploiting an attention-starved child to support his overzealous Christian parents.Jesus rides a rainbow horse.  Everybody has wings in Heaven.  The Holy Spirit basically looks like BooBerry.  Come on, now.If you think the movie is full of nonsense, read the book.  It will blow your mind that anyone gets away with this.  Really.  Colton's dad is going to fight in the end time.  It's going to be just as Revelation claims!  Literally.  Monsters and all.This movie is really about the father and, to a lesser extent, the mother.  Two poor Christians looking to make a spectacle of their child in order to bring in the cash flow.  The movie is less obvious than the book, but their true selves shine through.  This is not about a child's trip to Heaven.  It is about a father's manufacturing of an experience to excite complacent or bored Christians into coming to church and tithing like ATM's with food poisoning.No?  Look up how long it took for this &#34;experience&#34; to be revealed/reported to the world.  About as long as it takes to write a novel or two.Disgusting and heart-wrenching.  This child only wants to be loved and recognized and accepted as he is.  Yet he needs to jump through hoops and participate in an unconscionable fiction to gain his parents' attention.  This movie is an excellent eye-opener for the religious.  Stay home with your children more days than you go to church.  Maybe those prayer meetings can be skipped to show love to your child.AVOID AT ALL COSTS.  Certainly do not PAY for this tripe.\", \"It is quite disturbing , for multiple reasons . The story is from a kid who just happens to be a preachers kid ( oh , just what are the odds of that ) and it's clear the dad had means , motive and opportunity to convince the kid that he had been to other worlds . I don't know about the right wing but centuries of science hasn't shown any evidence of an afterlife and believing this kids dad brainwashing him is just as realistic as an afterlife . The fact that Hollywood is giving this guy what he wanted is repulsive . The religious right is repulsive for being so desperate to brainwash a kid . Hence this is where their arrogance shows . It's okay for them to take , shall we say , an extreme stance because of course , there're right and you're wrong . How does anyone make such a call . The mission of the hardcore church is the product of powerful egos . It's the greed of the industry which thrives hypocrisy . Which industry . That question is to be answered , albeit easily , by yourself .\", \"&#34;Proxy&#34; makes the mistake of making very specific connections amongst its characters and in its storyline yet sprinkles the world its created within its frames of celluloid with plot holes like some sort of crater-loving Johnny Appleseed. The common thread in the film only seems to be insane behavior with little to no explanation.After Esther loses her baby, you're introduced to her lesbian lover Anika (Kristina Klebe) who is basically a complete knockoff of Lisbeth Salander from &#34;The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.&#34; Anika is covered in tattoos and a complete freak in the bedroom. This is something the film points out on more than one occasion. Anika is incredibly vindictive through and through. She enjoys Esther's company because of her craziness.Meanwhile Melanie's husband Patrick (Joe Swanberg) is not a good father. He's more infatuated with trying to come off as the &#34;cool dad&#34; than anything else. The Patrick character goes through some really funky stuff in the film. Something tragic happens to him and Melanie that affects them both. Melanie begins edging back into society while Patrick kind of retreats internally and resorts to brooding. The character begins having delusions that mostly revolve around torture. The way they haphazardly leave a shotgun lying around makes you wonder why tragedy didn't strike them sooner.If you dig a little and stretch what little substance is there, &#34;Proxy&#34; attempts to say something about people dealing with the grief of losing someone close to them, how the loss affects them, and overcoming what seems like crippling depression. But the film seems to illustrate that everyone under those conditions gives in to wrath and revenge especially when it comes to the Patrick and Anika characters.But none of the characters feel genuine. None of their actions seem like logical, real-life conclusions. The film is very slow-moving and bogged down from uneventful and long strings of dialogue. While &#34;Proxy&#34; is listed as a horror, it's not scary. The scariest part is getting through the entire thing. The film's highlight is a slow-motion shotgun blast sequence in a bathroom, but even that is laughably bad thanks to how thick and jelly-like the blood appears. &#34;Proxy&#34; only seems to illustrate that stupid, insane behavior is spread by proxy and everyone suffers, including the film's audience, because of it.\", \"Proxy feels kind of like a bad Ingmar Bergman drama crossed with an even worse Brian De Palma thriller.  The story starts off being about a pregnant young woman who is viciously attacked outside her obgyn's office but after a couple of twists turns out to be about something else entirely.  Proxy is way too slow and talky to work as a thriller with its two hour plus running time but the acting and writing are too campy for the movie to work as a drama, so you're basically left with a painfully slow exercise in watching unbalanced people do unbelievable things.  I would avoid this but some people might find Proxy's odd tone and twisted characters appealing.\", 'POORLY DUBBED, STORY LINE/PLOT VERY WEAK LEFT A LOT TO BE DESIRE.

We watched last night.  My mom and stepfather liked it.  I could not stand it.  There are a few reasons why.1. There was a lot of action going on.  Not much in the way of story.  I felt like I was watching the season finale of a show, not the first episode.2. There were a lot of characters being thrown at me all at once.  I honestly don&#8217;t remember the names of any of the characters.3. Am I supposed to like the main character?  He is a traitor.  He is a dirty cop who will let his group do whatever they want.  He did take care of one guy.  But the way he did it made me hate him even more.  I understand that they are probably trying to show that it is hard for him, being on both sides.  But I do not care.  I hate the character and do not care if he lives or dies.4. Finally, I wonder how long they will be able to go with this type of story?  I mean, how long can they have a character playing both sides before it just gets ridiculous?  Will they have something in which every five or six episodes, he gets close to getting caught?  Again, that will get old fast.I will try this show again.  I am stuck with it now because my mom and step dad like it.  But I think it sucks to put it simply.', '\"The Sacrament\" is nothing more than a very LAME account of the Jonestown/Guyana tragedy which actually took place and where people actually died.  I guess Ti West and Eli Roth were counting on the fact that since the true tragedy had some age on it, they could try and pass this garbage as something original.  Trouble is, there was nothing original about this.You have some reporters who decide they are going to do a \"piece\" on this (fictional) city of Eden Parish.  The filmmakers never bother to tell you where this town was located...I guess because their script writers were not that smart to come up with an unoriginal one.  But I digress.  Seems one of the reporters has a sister who has decided to go beyond the pale and has headed wherever it is Eden Parish is located.  Once they arrive, they start their interviews and all seems well.  But then, people start confessing they are being held against their will, the reporters cannot shut their mouths long enough to get out of Dodge, and then all the people of Eden Parish are forced to drink poison--yes, these filmmakers couldn\\'t even come up with something original for this, so they used what Jim Jones doled out in Guyana:  Kool-Aid laced with some type of poison.I am not going to address the so-called \"acting\" in here because it was non-existent.  \"Father\" (a/k/a Jim Jones) should have been killed during his stint as the clerk in \"No Country for Old Men.\"  He just sorta\\' \"is,\" and that\\'s it.  As usual, Ti West and Eli Roth have delivered yet another stinker to add to their collection.

To do what you did is to literally show no respect for the dead.Shame on you.', \"Dubbed.

Well, we were right and we were wrong.  We actually left after about 50 minutes, but what I saw was so stupid.  The movie had an art house feel.  People get neighbors.  They are a frat.  They ask them to keep it down and things go crazy.  That is the movie, at least from what I saw.There are so many things that happen that just didn't need to.  Like the guy being able to get an erection whenever he chooses.  I mean, really?  It just didn't make me laugh at all.Some of the stuff made me feel uncomfortable.  I know this is a movie, and none of this actually happened.  Still, it made me feel uncomfortable.  Like when the two are having sex and the baby is sitting right there looking at them.  I know what they were trying to do, but it didn't work.  The guy starts smoking a joint and there baby is there.  That didn't work either.  The two worst parts I saw were when the baby put the condom in it's mouth and when the doctor told them the baby had aids.  He was kidding, but I didn't find it funny.I have this pre ordered.  I may cancel that and just rent it when it comes out.  As I said, we saw like 50 minutes.  But, it felt like 15 or 20.  The movie just has the same thing happening over and over again.  It was just a childish movie.  If they didn't have the baby, it could have been better.  It is like they used the kid as a prop.  It was a waste of $16.50.After thinking a bit more about it.I was thinking more about this throughout the day.  Here are my thoughts.This movie has three parts.One is, two people who have a kid and are not yet ready to live the life of two adults.  They want to continue living a life of fun and continue to be carefree.Two, a couple still feel young and want to hang out with people younger with them.  They want to live their life with the people they want to believe themselves to be.Three, people have neighbors that are driving them crazy, care nothing about their feelings and live a crazy life.I asked myself.  If any of these parts were taken out, would the movie have been better?The part with them having a kid and not being ready to live like parents. That could be funny.  I think they could have made that a fun movie.  If they took out all the random use of the F-word, all the sex and random drug use.  I think it could have been great.If it would have been about two married people trying to live like they did when they were kids or teens.  That could have been funny.  If they did a movie like that and took the child out, it could have been really funny.  With the kid not in all the scenes, they could have swore, drank, did all the drugs and had all the sex they wanted.  I would have laughed a piece of my ass off.If they did a movie in which a couple tried to get rid of bad neighbors.  That could have been funny as well.  It would all depend on who was trying and whom they were trying to get rid of.  Husband and wife trying to get rid of neighbors would have added a fun element.  The actions and reactions between the two would have made for some good laughs.The problem is that I don't see how these three things can fit into one hour and a half movie.Another thing I realized is that perhaps some of it had to do with the actors.  I am not saying any are bad.  I like all of the actors I saw.  But, seeing Zac Efron as a druggy, partying teen didn't work for me.  I do not believe I have seen him in anything.  But it just didn't feel right.Dave Franco.  He seemed like a good actor.  I do not know what I have seen him in either.  But it just felt like he was wrong for the character.  I cannot explain why.Another reviewer said something.  They said it felt like you were watching clips.  I thought the exact thing as we were leaving the movie.  Nothing seemed to go together.  No story at all, or maybe there was a story, they just did not pull it off.There is a part of me that wants to finish the movie.  I want to see if there is any point to it and what the conclusion is.  That is why I kept my pre order.\", \"All I got was a preview or interview of what the season was about. I didn't get to the third season at all. What's up with that?\", \"I give up.

Discordant strings and chaotic cameras try to force thrilling atmospheres during the following anticlimaxes: the alpha-nerd discovers a slashed tire, a girl with some blood on her appears at the door (sending one of the quintet into borderline shock), the mysterious visitor subsequently locks them out of their cabin (oh the humanity!).  OMG, you gotta love the 8 minute, not-so-riveting argument on whether to go out into the dark night and find one of the team where they finally convince his wife to wait till morning by saying \"please... help us get Doug back\" (*camera zooms in on bewildered wife, mouth agape while crickets chirp gleefully in the background*).Featuring the most spineless, indecisive and petty, horror-movie-victim groups of all time hunted by a slasher of epically lame proportions (ooooo... his eyes are milky-white... s.s..scarrrry) \"The Killing of Jacob Marr\" comprises 1 hour/51 minutes of pure, cinematic flatulence.

The universal acclaim it gets from top-notch critics is alarming, if not terrifying. In fact, Willow Creek\\'s high ratings is the only \"scary\" thing about this movie you will find.When a new found-footage flick gets dumped in theaters, the first word that comes to mind is gimmick. This type of film making attempts to create suspense the cheap way, in light of budget constraints. Very few films are better off having been filmed like this. Chronicle is the only recent one that comes to mind.There have been many, and I mean *MANY* advancements in this film style since The Blair Witch Project. Unfortunately, Willow Creek is so shoestring, that it is more or less a step back into 1999. The budget (if there is one), is not conducive to a monster movie. Let alone Bigfoot, the least terrifying monster anyone can make a movie about.The obvious payoff would be an actor running around in a fur suit, making horny gorilla sounds. If done correctly, the blurry footage would reenact the infamous Patterson-Gimlin sighting. Willow Creek does not end this way.***SPOILER ALERT***Instead of a cheap monkey costume, or even a furry ape hand, the Bigfoot of Willow Creek turns out to be more than one. What the movie does show us is a female variation that is basically a fat 40-something with slinky tits hanging down to her waist, wearing nothing but adult diapers and what looks to be some sort of necklace (an alligator foot?), that was purchased at the nearest truck stop. That\\'s it, no joke. The rest of the final scene involves loud growling and screeching coming from an unseen Bigfoot party as the star couple is mauled and dragged to their death. This entire sequence involves the cameraman\\'s video recorder zoomed in on tall grass as it\\'s dragged along with its owner.Does Willow Creek break any new ground, add something new to the genre, or deliver anything in terms of entertainment value?

It's so bad that after struggling to watch it for 20 minutes I decided that if the world ended in a few minutes, there is no way in hell I'd want to die watching this.

Now, I haven't got a clue how you make soundtracks. That's why I don't make them. The moral is: if you're going to charge people money for something, you need to have some clue - some inkling - of how to make that thing.The video quality was awful too, but that may have been Amazon's fault. Sometime's streaming is like that. It did look though like it was recorded on VHS. In this day and age, that's a miracle.I managed to figure out that one of the main characters had visions of something, possibly some beings from outer space, who instructed him to do stuff and told him about the future. These visions, ugh, how can I explain this. Think the 70s-80's. Think, again, of VHS. Think made for TV. Think infomercials. Think of an ad for Vegas/timeshares/used cars. Think of the cheesiest low budget thing made that would fit into those categories.

By the end, viewers were left with a ruin of jumbled concepts and terrible dialogue, as well as characters that the writers couldn't seem to agree on, each script pulling them in different directions. Instead of establishing psychological complexity, it left an impression of indecisive, inconsistent writing; and the details surrounding the revised and expanded plot-line became straight-up hilarious, taking one of King's stupider books and somehow managing to dumb it down further.I was interested to see if the producers might have been able to salvage something from the smoking rubble they had left themselves with, taking the downtime between filming periods to rebuild the story for season 2. But episode 1 made it pretty clear that Under the Dome is unfixable. Stephen King scripted the season premiere, which no doubt piqued the interest of even those viewers who had abandoned all hope during season 1, but my god... keep that man away from all film sets. While some of his books have been adapted into great films -- The Shining, Stand By Me, and The Mist come to mind -- whenever he gets involved in the transition process, things go horribly wrong. An unintentionally hilarious 'crisis' strikes Chester's Mill once again, as the now sentient Dome throws a hissy-fit and somehow magnetizes itself. As metallic objects start flying through the air in the cheap, clunky manner of the original Star Trek, Under the Dome became a total write-off. I continued watching but ceased to care.\", 'Last season was so much better.', 'While I certainly wouldn\\'t claim that the first season represented the pinnacle of acting and dialog, season 2 has somehow managed to find a way through the bottom of that barrel and plunged to new depths of poor production and ludicrous logic. It\\'s probably no spoiler than season 1 ended with Barbie (yes, that\\'s a guy\\'s real name in this show) with a noose around his neck on the gallows - this is resolved in the first episode in the most uninspired, incredulous, eye-rolling and ultimately lame way in seconds before they drop him to certain death. And that\\'s the best thing that happens.Who might be the screenwriter for this first episode? Was it a second-grader finishing a corrective English assignment or the overrated \"master of horror\" himself Stephen King? Seriously, I\\'m surprised he didn\\'t introduce an author with writer\\'s block as a lead character.

Things that happen for no reason are blamed on the island, I mean dome, which exists purely to act as a sandbox around a bunch of overwrought D-list actors (if only I bottle up their energetic overacting and sell it). Plot-wise, they can throw anything into the mix from resurrection the dead (done that) to changing physics (done that, too) and getting all pseudo-intellectual (please don\\'t do that).

Netflix is making toast out of Amazon's attempts at films.\", \"When &#34;Under the Dome&#34; premiered in the summer of 2013, I was excited as anyone to see Stephen King's novel come to life.  That excitement seemed to have payed off, as the few first episodes were mind-boggling in terms of visuals and atmosphere.  Simply put, the show looked like a real winner.Sadly, I don't know if I've ever seen a show take such a nose-dive.  For the last half of Season One and so far into this Second Season, the quality of the plots/characters has descended into an absolute mess.  I usually don't like to review an &#34;unfinished product&#34;, so to speak, but I became so frustrated with this show that I had to cut ties.  The other night, I sat down to watch the third episode of this second season.  About 15 minutes in, I thought to myself &#34;why am I watching anymore?&#34;.  It had become a chore, and that's when I know it is time to hang it up.Basically, I think what happened to this show is that it made the decision to stray from King's novel.  Had they just done a 10-15 episode mini-series and stuck to the events King penned, this show might have really worked.  As it is now, though, they are just treading water (and, I would argue, barely staying afloat) and wasting time.  The characters are going nowhere, each episode does very little to resolve (or sometimes even reference) the dome mystery, and let's face it...acting was never a strong suit of &#34;Under The Dome&#34;.It pains me to say, as I had such high hopes and excitement for this show, but it is a mess right now.  Until the show creators make the decision to narrow the focus and actually start focusing on real issues (not just a &#34;story of the week&#34;) approach, it will continue to flounder.  I have a feeling, though, that the viewing public will not stick around longer enough to give them that opportunity.\", \"Was really looking forward to this as the premise mirrors my own life in so many ways, but oy, the writing is weak, the main character is a piece of wood (we're supposed to think he's deeply disturbed and divided through flashbacks of him as a kid protecting his older brother), but there's no vision of the turmoil inside Barry (Basam) except through his tepid American (blonde, of course) wife, who keeps pestering him and saying there's no joy in their life (well, why hang around so long then?).  So Barry/Basom clearly has issues to work on, and I liked the storyline, but there's no depth, it's all formulaic cartoon that was done much better in Syriana and other films on Arab potentates, the potential for political reform, good son vs. bad son, etc.  Bummer.  Could've been a contender.\", \"Honestly, I should have paid better attention to the 1-star reviews. I love both Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd, which is why I feel terrible for what I'm about what I'm about to say: It was painful to watch. There wasn't anything even remotely laugh-worthy. I watched the entire movie hoping that there would be some redeeming qualities, but sadly - there were none. I honestly hate to say this, but please don't waste your time. I'm doing you a favor!\", \"Parody of romantic comedies is a huge disappointment given all of the talent involved.  The idea was to do a meta romantic comedy that comments on all of the clich&eacute;s of the genre while also indulging in them--it feels like two thirds of the movie features the actors talking in air quotes.  Unfortunately with his focus on being clever writer director David Wain forgot to bring any laughs.  Seriously, I've seen god-awful straight-to-video horror movies by The Asylum that were much funnier than this.Not that it matters but if They Came Together really wanted to parody Hollywood romantic comedies then Amy Poehler is miscast--she isn't pretty enough to be a lead in an actual Hollywood romantic comedy and would likely end up playing the sassy best friend.  Paul Rudd, on the other hand, has the leading man good looks but he isn't capable of elevating weak material, which is what he's stuck with here.Some people may be able to get on the same wavelength as They Came Together but I found it to be an unfunny drag that was torture to sit through--I actually stopped the movie several times and pondered whether it was worth trying to make it to the end or not.  It wasn't.\", \"It wasn't my cup of tea. I know most romcoms stink but I gave this one a chance. Bad idea.\", \"This is second only to &#34;Dinner for Schmucks&#34; as the dumbest movie I've ever seen.  I THINK it's supposed to be a spoof on romcoms, but that's just a guess -- that's how bad it is.  I'm surprised that Amy Poehler would agree to appear in such an awful film.  I like Paul Rudd, but he'll appear in anything. I thought Poehler was more discerning.  Save your money!\", \"Publicizing a movie is very expensive but here in the guise of honest viewer reviews, false advertising with faked praise reviews by those who have a connection with the films, it's FREE.\", 'Let\\'s stipulate that Halle Berry is a beautiful and talented actress.  Based on this show we can safely conclude that beauty and talent are not enough to save a mediocre script.  Alone in a CGI space something or other Ms. Berry becomes mysteriously pregnant, apparently by the ghost of her dead husband (?).  The Space Agency\\'s medical director agrees to conceal this salient detail from the agency.  Had enough yet?  It gets worse.  A parallel plot re-cycles, almost verbatim, the basic elements of \"Artificial Intelligence\", Mr. Spielberg\\'s 2001 mess about creating a child-robot (android).  Not to be confused with the child Ms. Berry\\'s character is purportedly bearing. The whole thing is stirred into a thin soup of bad dialogue and mediocre acting.  BTW:  I agree in general with the Infinite Loop review (see above).  Originality is not on display here.', \"a 'LifeTime Movie' in spaaaaace.
