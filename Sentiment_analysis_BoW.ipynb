        "I would start by saying that the majority of the sentences comes from the review text, which is quite straightforward considering that each review contains much more sentences than the summary text. I haven't specifically did the preprocessing on the tokens, as for sentiment analysis we would only want to do the lowercasing, but not the lemantization or stemming. Also, I did some preprocessing by lower casing on the bigrams after I created them. \n",
        "In general, at the first sight it seams that most of the sentences are on average are 108 long if we take the average of the len_sent column \"merged['len_sent'].mean()\". And also, I would want to not that for summary the average length is 108, while for the reviewT the average lenght is 26. The other instances can be further analysed using the merged.csv file on its own. "

        "Negation handling and stop word removal are common techniques used in natural language processing to improve the accuracy of text analysis.\n",
        "\n",
        "Negation handling involves identifying and modifying the meaning of words in a sentence when they appear in a negated context. For example, the word \"good\" in the sentence \"This is not good\" has a different meaning than the word \"good\" in the sentence \"This is good\". Negation handling algorithms recognize negation words (e.g., \"not\", \"never\", \"no\") and modify the meaning of the words that follow them to reflect the opposite of their usual meaning. Negation handling is important because it can significantly affect the sentiment of a sentence, and can lead to incorrect sentiment analysis if not handled properly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Stop word removal involves removing common words that are unlikely to have any significant meaning in the context of text analysis. Examples of stop words include \"a\", \"an\", \"the\", \"and\", \"in\", \"on\", \"at\", etc. Stop word removal can improve text analysis accuracy by reducing the number of words that need to be analyzed and focusing on the most important words. This can also help to reduce the computational complexity of text analysis algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both negation handling and stop word removal are important techniques in natural language processing and can help to improve the accuracy of text analysis tasks such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and information retrieval.\n",

        "It is really hard to make a conclusion from the result, however I believe we have finally reached a point where we can make at least some sense of the data and of the result of out analysis \n",

        "Okay, let's start from the beginining:\n",
        "\n",
        "1) Descriptive statistics\n",
        "\n",
        "I won't talk much about Descriptive statistics part, because I have already written a short text just before Sentiment analysis section. Overall, I believe in order to reach better result, we should also include the analysis of the bigrams numberically for example. What is the length of bigram list for each one: Review Text or Summary. What is the length of the Noun list and Adjective list. I have did some further analysis on that, and the average length for:\n",
        "\n",
        "Summary:\n",
        "Bigrams: 1.83\n",
        "NN_list: 1.24\n",
        "NN_lsit: 2.14 \n",
        "\n",
        "Review:\n",
        "Bigrams: 5.19\n",
        "NN_list: 2.25\n",
        "NN_list: 5.62\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2) Sentiment analysis\n",
        "\n",
        "I started by using the code from the lab 5. I think the movie reviews are really close to our data set, so we should have gotten better results than I did actually. Because our data set also has reviews about Tv shows and series from the Amazon Prime (I suppose), movie reviews are really close to our case. So, that was the reason for me to choose that data set. \n",
        "I started applying the code from the lab and got decent results in terms of accuracy, around 74.5. Appying Fscore, Recall and Precision methods I got around the same result.\n",
        "\n",
        "Using the  multi-fold cross-validation I had similar results in terms of the accuracy. Average of three folds was around 74.5.\n",
        "\n",
        "After I started applying the negation technique to my sentiment analysis, I noticed that the accuracy of the sentiment analysis improved, especially in cases where negation words were present. The negation technique helped to correctly identify the sentiment of the text data, and the resulting sentiment scores were more accurate and representative of the true sentiment expressed in the text. In general, the number (accuracy and all the iother scores stood at 76/77. \n",
        "\n",
        "Finally I removed some stop words, but the accuracy was almost the same, slightly higher standing at 77. \n",
        "\n",
        "After, I applied our classifier to the data set that we have. I result aws pretty decent, although I suppose we could have gotten better results. I have got much more positive tags rather than negative tags for both review and summary text. \n",
        "Than, I started by creating a new data frame, applied our classifier and got the top Adjectives, Nouns and Verbs for both negative and positive sentences. To be honest, the result for positive sentences makes sense but for the negative sentences I couldn't say so. Because, we have almost the same set of verbs, nouns and adjectives. However, some negative words were also in the top 50, such as \"bad\".\n",
        "\n",
        "And finally, I have plotted two graphs as asked in the instructions.
